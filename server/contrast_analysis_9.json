Interest rates, although not detailed in the context, generally influence borrowing costs and consumer spending, which can impact the company's revenue. Currency fluctuations can indirectly impact the company's results by affecting international sales revenue and costs associated with manufacturing and sourcing materials. These macroeconomic conditions have historically influenced the company's financial results and could materially impact its future operations and financial condition.",
