    "text": "The claim that Apple's revenue is expected to grow 4-6% YoY is supported by historical data showing a 4% increase in net sales in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same quarter in 2024. This growth was driven by increases in net sales across several segments, including a 14% growth in services net sales. The services segment, including advertising, the App Store, and cloud services, is expected to drive revenue growth in the next quarter. However, the claim about the continued adoption of high-end iPhones lacks specific strategies or plans in the provided information, but it does not contradict the overall revenue growth projection.",
