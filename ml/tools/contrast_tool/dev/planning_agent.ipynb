    "# Step 1: Extract Investment Theses\n",
    "\n",
    "From the first document, extract all distinct investment theses. Each thesis should represent a clear, concise, and reasoned hypothesis about why an investment is expected to generate positive returns. A good thesis typically includes:\n",
    "- A strategic rationale or competitive advantage.\n",
    "- A market or financial performance expectation.\n",
    "- A causal relationship between an observable factor and expected investment return.\n",
    "Do not include vague or generic statements. Only extract well-formed, specific hypotheses.\n",

    "# Step 2: Validate Theses Against Earnings Document\n",
    "\n",
    "For each thesis extracted:\n",
    "- Analyze the second document (earnings report) for any evidence that supports (validates) or contradicts (refutes) the thesis.\n",
    "- If no information is found relevant to the thesis, explicitly state this (do not speculate or infer).\n",

    "# Step 3: Classify claims into true, false, or unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"true\": The earnings document provides clear support for the thesis.\n",
    "- \"false\": The earnings document contradicts or undermines the thesis.\n",
    "- \"unknown\": The thesis is not addressed in the earnings document.\n",
    "\n",

    "You do not need to follow the order of steps strictly, but make sure you cover all the steps.\n",
