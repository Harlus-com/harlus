## I. What does Littelfuse do?

Edward Sundt worked at General Electric and found that his diagnostic equipment often experienced electrical failures. This prompted him to invent a small protective fuse to avoid this issue. When the US government refused Sundt a trademark for 'little fuse', he reversed the 'l' and the ' e ' to form Littelfuse in 1927 in Chicago, Illinois .

The stock is listed since 1992 and even though it exists for nearly 100 years, it is still a small company, generating only 2,5bn USD in revenue :

The core activity of Littelfuse is still what is called surge protection : fuses, circuit breakers, etc. Aside from  this,  the  company  has  used  its  electronics/electrical  expertise  to  also  branch  out  to  other products such as passives, discretes, sensors, switches and semiconductors. Below some images of the typical Littelfuse products:

Price points for Littelfuse products vary widely .  Simple fuses go for as little as 10 cents, whereas industrial solutions go for thousands of dollars. It's most practical to get a grasp of their products and price points through distributor websites such as www.digikey.be:

In the above table I have tried to list some of the most common products and tried to show the huge variety in price points. This being said, Littelfuse has thousands and thousands of SKUs and sells its products to &gt;100,000 end customers , so just like analog industrial chip companies (ADI, TXN) we are talking about an incomprehensibly wide range of products .

In terms of geographical reach, Littelfuse is globally active with 38% of sales in North America, 38% of sales Asia Pacific (23% of group is China) and 24% Europe. The issue with this is that these geographical

exposures are on a shipped-to basis . The true end client is not necessarily in the same place. So I would assume (as is usual with these kinds of companies) that China end demand is much lower than 23% and many of Littelfuse s products are used in assembly in China and shipped elsewhere in the end. I ' will take this up with management.

In terms of clients, no customer represents more than 10% of sales and I would assume the customer base to be extremely fragmented, as is usual for this kind of business.

## II. Why is this an attractive business?

The very simple pitch for why this is an attractive business is simply the fact that it is a perfect play on increasing levels of electrification . Just looking at the end markets of Littelfuse we note areas such as energy storage, renewable energy, data centres, factory automation, battery technology, EV charging infrastructure, etc.

Diversification expands global addressable market opportunities to $20+B*

In terms of moat, I think it is fairly straightforward that Littelfuse has much of the same characteristics as Analog Devices and Texas Instruments that contribute to its moat. Just think about how difficult it would be to replicate the huge assortment of solutions the company offers. It has operated 97 years in  this  niche  and  it  shows.  In  addition,  this  leads  to cumulative  learning that  is  very  difficult  to replicate. Littelfuse has 17,000 employees. On top of this, it has been able to build its brand name for 97 years with customers relying on this company for safety . As a final point, we all know that it pays to be in a business where the products are a very small % of the bill of materials of your client, yet serve a highly critical function . I think this criticality only increases when thinking of semi fabs or data centres that literally cost billions of dollars. Or electric vehicles or smartphones where your reputation is on the line if the electronics do not work properly, overheat or explode.

Littelfuse has a number of competitors, with the most important being Eaton Corporation, Bourns Inc, TDK, ON  Semiconductor, Infineon, STMicro, Semtech, Amphenol, Sensata, Mersen  and TE Connectivity.

## III. Management and capital allocation

See below for a quick overview of management. The CEO has been with the company for his entire career. This is something that stands out across the enterprise: apart from the CFO (who has been with the company for 9 years so not too bad either), most managers have been with the company for a very long time . Again, this is not very different from an ADI or TXN where managers stay for a

very long time and employee loyalty is very high . Just to quote an example, ADI is a company that exists for 56 years and is only at its 3 rd CEO and 2 nd chairman! I think this employee loyalty is very important  for  companies  where  engineers  perform  tasks  that  are  more  art  than  science. This probably also makes that it is difficult for them to switch companies, since they have to re-learn all the tools, software and collaborative way of working at a new company.

Prior to joining Littelfuse, Ms. Sethna served from 2011 to 2015 as Vice President   and Corporate Controller of Illinois Tool Works Inc. a diversified manufacturer of Ms. Sethna is Certified Public Accountant in Illinois.

I  have  read  many  of  the historical  annual  reports and  I  personally  really  like  how  this  company communicates and the way they run the business. I endlessly repeat myself, but in the end I find capital allocation to be the best metric to judge management.

As a quick example, when you read the 2012 annual report you'll see that then-CEO Gordon Hunter finishes his letter by the following conclusion:

## ACCELERATING GROWTH

Over the 10 years , we have built a solid track record for improved financial performance; with 10-year compound average excluding past growth special\_

We enter 2013 with a strong cash position:   We believe the best use of this cash is to invest in the long-term health of the business , which in turn can build value for our shareholders .

The overriding focus for the next five years is accelerating growth our pathway to a larger; stronger and more successful Littelfuse . Thank you for your support:

Gordon Hunter

Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

I  really  like  this.  They  clearly  state that  the  best  use  of  the  excess  cash  is  not  to  return  it  to shareholders but to invest it in the business. In his letter, he says very openly that this will be both organic and inorganic. Since then, the company has completed 15 acquisitions. In the ensuing decade since 2012, Littelfuse has grown its revenue from 668 million to 2,5 billion and has grown its earnings per share from 3,8 dollars to 16,8 dollars. The stock has compounded at 16% per year since then, including the weaker period recently.

Speaking of the acquisitions Littelfuse does, these are lots of acquisitions of small companies and the company operates these rather decentralized. This makes financial reporting very important. I find that Littelfuse's accounting is more prudent than I normally encounter . To state 3 simple examples:

- -There are very few GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments, which is especially impressive given the many  acquisitions,  which  usually  gives  companies  the  perfect  excuse  to  make  a  lot  of adjustments.
- -They constantly overstate net debt versus what you would calculate yourself. This is because they do not take into account cash that cannot be repatriated to the US.
- -Reporting over time has been perfectly consistent with very few changes.

In terms of capital allocation, we will see later on that Littelfuse generates very nice free cash flow . 40% of this FCF is returned to shareholders and 60% is used for M&amp;A . Taking into account the small dividend, all in all, there s not a big buyback story here. '

The CEO holds some 12mio USD in Littelfuse shares and is of course due to receive much more if he performs well in the future. The prior CEO, Gordon Hunter, hasn't sold a share since 2017.

## IV. Growth

Sales of Littelfuse have tripled over the last decade (2013-2023). This is of course under the influence of both organic growth as well as acquisitions. Littelfuse has only reported organic growth since 2017 and during this period, we've seen quite exceptional cycles: for instance, 2021 and 2022 generated 33%  and  11%  organic  growth,  respectively.  And  2023  and  2024  will  probably  both  demonstrate negative organic growth. 2023 organic growth was -10%.

So given all this, I wanted to get a good feel for what organic growth has been over the past decade. In order to do this, I listed all acquisitions and their sales numbers, put a 4% annual growth on them since  acquisition  and  calculated  the  remainder  as  organic  growth.  While  this  is  a  very  imperfect

exercise,  I  landed  at 4% organic growth  historically . This  compares  to  average  reported  organic growth of 5% over the last 7 years, so is probably fair.

Below is the list of acquisitions and what stands out to me is that they invested in the right themes well ahead of time . For instance, in 2012-2014 they acquired in automotive sensors which has proven to be a great growth area the last 5 years. In 2018 they completed 2 acquisitions (one of which was their largest acquisition in the past 10 years) focused on silicon carbide, which is all the rage the past 2-3 years given electric vehicles. It's always difficult to judge, but this goes back to my comment that I do believe that management are good capital allocators.

Littelfuse  has organized an investor day back in February, 2021, where they laid out their growth targets, aiming for double-digit revenue growth, in turn composed of:

- -5-7% organic growth
- -5-7% growth from acquisitions

Given the above analysis on organic growth, I think the target is achievable, especially looking at their end markets of automation, data centre, renewables, EV charging,  etc. Arguably, all of these end markets have gotten better over the last couple of years.

In terms of M&amp;A, it should be said that, since the investor day, Littelfuse has acquired companies with cumulative sales of 465mio USD. Versus the revenue base prior to investor day, this is a +32% uplift or 10% per year, so much better than 5-7%. As we will see later on, this M&amp;A has not increased debt or prohibited them from doing further deals, so this part of the target definitely seems reachable and probably feasible to do even more.

## V. Profitability

Taking a look at margins, it s clear that ' Littelfuse is not a big margin expansion story . It does not seem to be a major focus for management, who talk a lot more about growth and cash. Targets from the 2021-2025 period investor day are 17-19% operating margins (vs 16,5% in 2023) and 21-23% EBITDA margins (vs 22,3% in 2023).

<!-- image -->

To me, the best peers for Littelfuse are TE Connectivity, Amphenol and Eaton and it s straightforward ' to see they make almost exactly the same margins. This is even though TE, Amphenol and Eaton are respectively  7x,  5x  and  9x  larger  than  Littelfuse.  Other  companies  that  I  have  listed  in  the  chart (Schneider, ABB, Atlas Copco, … ) are just high-quality industrials but not necessarily direct peers to Littelfuse s activities. '

<!-- image -->

All in all, it s probably fair to say that margin expansion is not the highest priority for Littelfuse and I ' am  perfectly  fine  with  that.  I  think  margin  expansion  might  also  be  hampered  by  the  constant acquisitions that probably need some time to move up to the nice corporate average margin. This is something I will take up with the company during my call.

Turning to cash generation, I find it very encouraging that Littelfuse is able to constantly convert more than 100% of non-GAAP net income into free cash flow. This also goes back to my earlier comment that non-GAAP adjustments seem prudent and quality of earnings is high .

|                     | 2015    | 2016    | 2017    | 2018    | 2019    | 2020    | 2021    | 2022    | 2023    |
|---------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Free cash flow      | 121.807 | 133.905 | 203.245 | 257.075 | 183.433 | 201.840 | 282.782 | 315.377 | 371.199 |
| Non-GAAP net income | 113.366 | 142.388 | 177.519 | 238.165 | 169.082 | 157.286 | 329.006 | 421.406 | 294.785 |
| Conversion          | 107%    | 94%     | 114%    | 108%    | 108%    | 128%    | 86%     | 75%     | 126%    |

Average FCF conversion over the past decade has been 105%, with some variations over the years. Littelfuse  is  not  a  capital  intensive  business,  requiring  only  4-5%  of  sales  in  capex. This  FCF generation is of course also important for the funding of their M&amp;A activities.

Taking a look at the last 6 years, the company has acquired 7 companies with cumulative sales of 787mio USD. This is no less than 64% of 2017 sales. This has all been financed by internal cash generation and debt levels have barely budged. Over the same period, share count has not changed either. I really like the fact that they constantly acquire in an attractive industry and are able to do this without issuing shares, nor increasing debt to high levels. Also remember that this debt definition is very conservative, using only cash that can be repatriated to the US. If you take all the cash on the balance  sheet,  net  debt/EBITDA  for  2023  is  only  0,6x  versus  1,3x.  Management  targets  a  net debt/EBITDA between 1,5x -2,5x so we are very comfortable today.

|                 | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   |
|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Net debt/EBITDA | 0,5    | 0,5    | 2,3    | 1,2    | 1,4    | 1,3    |

## VI. Valuation

Given the volatility in revenues and earnings, I take a longer historical series and plot the P/E for various years using the 230 USD current share price , as I think this is more useful than looking at just one year.

After the fantastic EPS in 2022, the question is how quickly we will grow again from the reset base of 2023 and 2024. It is expected that 2024 is the bottom year for EPS on which we pay 24x earnings. My confidence  that  this  EPS  number  is  absolute  bottom  mostly  comes  from  the  fact  that  they already  generated  this  EPS  level  6  years  ago  in  2018  pre-COVID.  Since  then,  they  have  done numerous acquisitions and their end markets have been really strong, as demonstrated by the 20212022 EPS numbers. It is difficult to judge the slope of the recovery, but I am confident we are paying a good multiple here on through-the-cycle earnings.

For free cash flow, I don't use estimates but simply look at historical free cash flow and how that relates to current enterprise value:

|                | 2015    | 2016    | 2017    | 2018    | 2019    | 2020    | 2021    | 2022    | 2023    |
|----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Free cash flow | 121.807 | 133.905 | 203.245 | 257.075 | 183.433 | 201.840 | 282.782 | 315.377 | 371.199 |
| FCF/EV         | 2,0%    | 2,2%    | 3,4%    | 4,3%    | 3,1%    | 3,4%    | 4,7%    | 5,2%    | 6,2%    |

It has to be said that 2023 was exceptional in terms of FCF due to some working capital release etc. The 370mio will not be repeated in 2024. This being said, it is clear that we are not paying much on FCF either.

## VII. Risks

As is always the case with volatile businesses, the risk is that the recovery takes much longer than I think or is much less steep and it takes a lot of years to go back to the 16-17 dollars in EPS. In addition, it s a business with a very large number of SKUs, end markets and clients, which makes it more difficult ' to grasp the business and get a feeling for it.
