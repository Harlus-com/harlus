Facts

Solid quarter and increased confidence for 2025. Innovation leadership to drive ongoing market share gains.

Applied Materials is a market leading semiconductor equipment supplier in many steps of the manufacturing process. They should benefit from the ever increasing thirst for semiconductors worldwide, enabling the digitization of the economy and the  build-out  of  the  data  infrastructure  that  will  make  artificial  intelligence flourish. Innovation should sustain their leading position.

## FACT

Applied  Materials  reported  Q2  sales  (period  ending  April  30th)  that  were marginally  up  yoy,  reaching  a  record  Q2  high  of  $6.65bn,  well  ahead  of  the $6.5bn expected. Semiconductor System sales (74% of total) were only slightly down by 1.5%, this on a high base. Sales to logic customers (65% of quarterly sales) dropped by 24%, as many semiconductor clients are going through an inventory correction.  Note that the base here was also very demanding as Q2 last year recorded 44% growth. The strong decline to logic customers was offset by a exceptional strong growth to DRAM customers (32% of Q2 sales), as sales grew by 184% yoy to reach a Q2 record high of $1.57bn. This was driven by clients  investing  heavily  in  new  capacity  for  High  Bandwidth  Memory.  HBM achieves higher bandwidth, while using less power in a substantially smaller form factor.  It  is  achieved  by  stacking  up  to  eight  DRAM  dies.  The  stack  is  often connected to the memory controller on a GPU or CPU through a substrate. It is ideal for processing massive  amounts  of  data  produced  by  complex  AI applications. AMAT expects revenue coming from HBM equipment to multiply by x6 this year, growing to more than $600mn. The Services business (23% of total sales)  grew  sales  by  7%  yoy  as  the  tools  under  subscription  agreements increased by 8%. Their installed base of tools surpassed 200k for the first time. Over 80% of services revenue comes from recurring services and parts, of which 2/3 rd  is delivered under long term service agreements that have a 90% renewal rate. The small display business (3% of sales) reported sales up by 6.5%, with AMAT becoming more confident that the OLED technology found in smartphones will be adopted in notebooks, PC's and tablets.

From a profitability point of view, the EBITDA margin was about flat at 32.5%, as sales were unchanged. FCF to Equity generation during the first two quarters of their year amounted to $3.2bn, which is slightly down yoy, if we exclude the volatile working capital component. AMAT repurchased for $1.5bn in own shares during their H1 (0.8% of market cap), while paying $530mn in dividends (0.7% annualized yield).  Over the past 10 years, AMAT repurchased for over $26bn in own shares, reducing the share count by over 30% in the period. Since 2006, the share count almost halved. AMAT remains committed to distribute 80% to 100% of shareholders over time. Net cash increased to close to $5bn, up from $3.6bn at the start of their FY.

Outlook

For their Q3 (ending July 31 st ), AMAT guided for sales of $6.65bn, plus minus $400mn. This implies yoy growth of 3.5% yoy, gradually seeing improved growth

Wealth Management 5 Group Foyer again after 3 quarters of negative growth. The gross margin is expected to be 47%, up from 46.2% in the same quarter one year ago. Adjusted EPS is expected to  be  $2.01,  up  from  $1.90  last  year.  In  the  earnings  call,  Applied  Materials sounded optimistic on their innovation pipeline and strong growth for the coming years. According to AMAT the 4 key semiconductor technologies that power AI datacenters are 1) leading edge logic (GPU's and CPU's), 2) high performance DRAM, 3) High Bandwidth memory and 4) advanced packaging to connect the logic and memory chips together. AMAT has process technology leadership in all 4  of  these  areas.  The  group  made  significant  investments  in  next  generation solutions that are essential for their customer's future road map. In advanced logic, AMAT has long-standing leadership in the materials engineering process for both  transistors  and  interconnects.  With  chips  now  transitioning  to  gate-allaround (from FinFet) the group is gaining share as they are on track to capture over 50% of the process equipment spending for transistor steps. The group has also a strong market share in interconnect as backside power is introduced into volume manufacturing. AMAT expects to generate more than $2.5bn of revenue from  gate-all-around  nodes  and  potentially  more  than  double  that  in  2025. Another important element that we learned from meeting the company at the RJ conference is the fact that all of their  equipment in the different steps of the semiconductor manufacturing process are attuned to each other. As semiconductor processing becomes increasingly complex, AMAT know s exactly what the challenges and complexities are per step. While clients used to buy equipment from different providers in different steps, they now buy more and more equipment from the same provider. Because AMAT has by far the widest portfolio  of  equipment  for  most  steps,  this  plays  at  their  advantage.  In  the earnings  call,  AMAT  mentioned  that  the  portion  of  revenues  generated  by integrated solutions has grown from 20% in 2019 to 30% today.

We see no reason to adjust our estimates. Requiring 9% on investment, our updated fair value amounts to $232, about 5% above today's share price. FCF to Equity  yields  are  gradually  becoming  more  expensive  at  3.8%  for  this  year, growing to 4.7% in our year 3.
