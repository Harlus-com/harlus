## Segments

The Company conducts its business through three reportable segments: Electronics, Transportation, and Industrial. Within these segments, the Company designs, manufactures and sells electronic components, modules and subassemblies to empower the long-term secular growth themes of sustainability, connectivity and safety. Over the last decade the Company has positioned itself within the center of these global structural growth themes by helping to enable its customers' applications focused on a more sustainable, connected, and safer world. The ever-increasing complexity of applications surrounding these themes continues to drive  greater  demand  for  the  Company's  innovative,  reliable  products  and  a  higher  level  of  product  content  within  a  broad  range  of  applications.  With  its expanding, diversified, product portfolio, the Company has evolved its presence across the industrial, transportation and electronics end markets it serves. The Company's exposure with each of these end markets is relatively balanced. With a deep list of target applications within each primary end market, the Company believes its balanced approach positions its business for the long-term sustainability, increases diversification and creates additional growth opportunities. Across electronics end markets, product demand is largely driven by electrification, energy and power efficiency, automation, connectivity, artificial intelligence, and safety. In transportation end markets, including passenger and commercial vehicles, the ongoing electronification and electrification of applications is driving increased  product  demand.  Across  industrial  end  markets,  product  demand  is  driven  by  an  ecosystem  that  continues  to  advance  sustainability,  safety  and automation capabilities. For example, renewables, including solar and wind energy, and energy storage systems that enable lower carbon emissions, the ongoing proliferation of electric vehicles and charging stations, more efficient climate control units, increasing requirements for electrical safety, the rising demand for factory  and  process  automation,  and  motor  drives  and  power  supplies.

## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

The Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors it has identified below. Any of the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, or results of operations. These factors are not necessarily listed in order of importance.

## 1) Operational Risks:

## The Company's industry is subject to intense competitive pressures.

The Company operates in markets that are highly competitive. The Company competes on the basis of price, product performance and quality, service, and / or brand name across the industries and markets it serves. Competitive pressures could affect the prices the Company is able to charge its customers or demand for its products.

The Company may not always be able to compete on price, particularly when compared to manufacturers with lower cost structures. Some of the Company's competitors have substantially greater sales, financial and manufacturing resources and may have greater access to capital than the Company. As other companies enter its markets or develop new products, competition may further intensify. The Company's failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations.

## The  Company  engages  in  strategic  acquisitions  and  may  not  realize  the  anticipated  benefits  of  the  acquisitions  and  /  or  may  encounter  difficulties  in integrating these businesses.

The Company seeks to grow through strategic acquisitions. In the past, the Company has acquired a number of businesses or companies and additional product lines and assets. The Company intends to continue to expand and diversify its operations with additional future acquisitions.

An acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to the Company's expectations and the price paid for it, or not perform in accordance with the Company's anticipated timetable. This could cause the Company's financial results to differ from expectations in any given fiscal period, or over the long term. The success of these transactions also depends on the Company's ability to integrate the assets, operations, and personnel associated with these acquisitions. The Company may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with the Company's operations and may not realize the degree or timing of the benefits that are anticipated from an acquisition.

The Company may also discover liabilities or deficiencies associated with the companies or assets it acquires that were not identified in advance, which may result in significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness of the Company's due diligence review and its ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies acquired or their representatives, as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, the Company may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including tax and accounting charges. Acquisitions may also result in recording of significant additional expenses to the results of operations and recording of substantial intangible assets on the balance sheet upon closing. Any of these factors may adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

## Disruptions in the Company's manufacturing, supply or distribution chain could result in an adverse impact on results of operations.

The Company sources materials and sells product through various global network channels. A disruption could occur within the Company's manufacturing, distribution or supply chain network. This could include damage or destruction due to various causes including natural disasters or political instability which would cause one or more of these network channels to become non-operational. This could adversely affect the Company's ability to manufacture or deliver its products in a timely manner, impair its ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales or damage to its reputation. Such a disruption could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

## The Company may be unable to manufacture and deliver products in a manner that is responsive to its customers' needs.

The end markets for the  Company's products  are  characterized  by  technological  change,  frequent  new  product  introductions  and  enhancements,  changes  in customer requirements and emerging industry standards. The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render its existing products obsolete and

unmarketable before it can recover any or all of its research, development, and commercialization expenses on capital investments. Furthermore, the life cycles of its products may change and are difficult to estimate.

The Company's future success will depend upon its ability to manufacture and deliver products in a manner that is responsive to its customers' needs. The Company will need to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address increasingly sophisticated requirements of its customers. The Company invests heavily in research and development without knowing if it will recover these costs. The Company's competitors may develop products or technologies that will render its products non-competitive or obsolete. If it cannot develop and market new products or product enhancements in a timely and cost-effective manner, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

## The Company's business may be interrupted by labor disputes or other interruptions of supplies.

A work stoppage could occur at certain Company facilities, most likely as a result of disputes under collective bargaining agreements or in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements. In addition, the Company may experience a shortage of supplies for various reasons, such as financial distress,  work  stoppages,  natural  disasters,  or  production  difficulties  that  may  affect  one  of  its  suppliers. A  significant  work  stoppage,  or  an  interruption  or shortage of supplies for any reason, if protracted, could substantially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

## Failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could affect the Company's business results.

The Company's success in its existing and acquired businesses, depends on the Company's ability to attract, retain, and motivate a highly-skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Failure to ensure that the Company has the depth and breadth of personnel with the necessary skill set and experience could impede its ability to deliver growth objectives and execute the Company's strategy. Competition for qualified employees among companies that rely heavily upon engineering and technology is at  times  intense,  and  the  loss  of  qualified  employees  could  hinder  the  Company's  ability  to  conduct  research  activities successfully and develop marketable products.

## The Company may not be successful protecting its intellectual property.

The  Company considers  its  intellectual  property,  including  patents,  trade  names,  and  trademarks,  to  be  of  significant  value  to  its  business  as  a  whole.  The Company's products are manufactured, marketed, and sold under a portfolio of patents, trademarks, licenses, and other forms of intellectual property, some of which expire or are allowed to lapse at various dates in the future. The Company develops and acquires new intellectual property on an ongoing basis and considers all of its intellectual property to be valuable. The Company's policy is to file applications and obtain patents for the great majority of its novel and innovative new products including product modifications and improvements. Based on the broad scope of its product lines, the Company believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material adverse effect upon its consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows; however, multiple losses or expirations could have a material adverse effect upon the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

## 2) Regulatory Risks:

## Climate change, and the regulatory and legislative developments related to climate change, may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

The potential physical impacts of climate change on our business operations are highly uncertain and differ in each geographic region where we operate. These impacts may include changes in weather patterns and increased weather intensity, water shortages, changing sea levels and changing temperatures. The impacts of climate change may materially and adversely impact the cost of production, insurance availability, and financial performance of our operations. Further, any impacts to our business and financial condition as a result of climate change are likely to occur over a sustained period of time and are therefore difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity. For example, extreme weather events may result in adverse physical effects on portions of our or others infrastructure, which could disrupt our supply chain and our customers and ultimately our business operations. In addition, disruption of transportation and distribution systems could result in reduced operational efficiency and customer service interruption. Climate-related events have the potential to disrupt our business, including the business of our suppliers and customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, and additional costs to resume operations.

Increased government or governmental bodies contemplating legislative and regulatory changes in response to the potential impact of climate change could impose significant costs on us and our suppliers and customers, including increased cost of

## Table of Contents

materials and natural resources, sources and supply of energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting, or other costs to comply with such regulations. Potential regulations or standards could mandate more restrictive manufacturing requirements, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions and material used in production. Some jurisdictions have already passing such laws. For example, California enacted legislation in 2023 requiring disclosure of certain  companies'  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions,  climate-related  financial  risks,  voluntary  carbon  offsets  (VCOs),  and  certain  climate-related  emission claims. Any future climate change regulations could also adversely impact our ability to compete with companies not subject to such regulations.

## Changes in U.S. and other countries trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences, may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

In the past several years, the U.S. government adopted a new approach to trade policy and in some cases to renegotiate, or potentially terminate, certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements. It also imposed tariffs on certain foreign goods and products. These measures may materially increase costs for goods imported into the U.S. This in turn could require us to materially increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we do not or are unable to increase prices, could result in lower margins on products sold. Changes in U.S. trade policy have resulted in, and could result in more, U.S. trading partners adopting responsive trade policies making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries. Additionally, continued geo-political issues may result in customers in China seeking to source products from local suppliers, which could result in lower sales or lost customers.

## The Company is exposed to political, economic, and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business.

The Company's customers, suppliers, employees and operations are located in numerous countries around the world, and contribute significantly to its revenues and earnings. Sales to customers outside the U.S. constituted approximately 65% of the Company's net sales in fiscal 2023, including approximately 23% to China, which decreased from 25% in fiscal 2022.

Economic conditions in China have been, and may continue to be, volatile and uncertain. In addition, the legal and regulatory system in China continues to evolve and is subject to change. There also continues to be significant uncertainty about the relationship between the U.S. and China, including with respect to geopolitics, trade policies, treaties, government regulations, and tariffs. Further deterioration of economic conditions or outlook, such as lower economic growth, recession or fears of recession in China may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of our products and services.

Many of the Company's key customers are located outside of U.S. and maintain global operations. Serving a global customer base and remaining competitive in the  global  marketplace  requires  the  Company  to  diversify  its  operations  outside  the  U.S.  to  capitalize  on  customer  and  market  opportunities,  build  a  global workforce and maintain a cost efficient structure. In addition, the Company sources a significant amount of raw materials, components and finished goods from third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers. The Company's operating activities are subject to a number of risks generally associated with multi-national operations, including risks relating to the following:

- · general economic conditions;
- · currency fluctuations and exchange restrictions;
- · import and export duties and restrictions;
- · the imposition of tariffs and other import or export barriers;
- · compliance with regulations governing import and export activities;
- · current and changing regulatory requirements;
- · political and economic instability;
- · potentially adverse income tax consequences;
- · transportation delays and interruptions;
- · labor unrest;
- · natural disasters;
- · terrorist activities;
- · war and acts of war
- · public health concerns, including the outbreak of the coronavirus or other pandemics;
- · difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; and
- · limitations on the Company's ability to enforce legal rights and remedies.

Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

## Table of Contents

## Environmental liabilities could adversely impact the Company's financial position.

Foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations impose various restrictions and controls on the discharge of materials, chemicals and gases used in the Company's manufacturing processes or in its finished goods. These environmental regulations have required the Company to expend a portion of its resources and capital on relevant compliance programs. Under these laws and regulations, the Company could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if its current or former properties are contaminated or if it sends waste to a landfill or recycling facility that becomes contaminated, even if the Company did not cause the contamination. The Company may be subject to additional common law claims if it releases substances that damage or harm third parties. In addition, future changes in environmental laws or regulations may require additional investments in capital equipment or the implementation of additional compliance programs. Any failure to comply with new or existing environmental laws or regulations could subject the Company to significant liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

In the conduct of manufacturing operations, the Company has handled and does handle materials that are considered hazardous, toxic or volatile under federal, state,  and  local  laws. The risk of accidental release of such materials cannot be completely eliminated. In addition, the Company operates or owns facilities located  on  or  near  real  property  that  was  formerly  owned  and  operated  by  others.  Certain  of  these  properties  were  used  in  ways  that  involved  hazardous materials. Contaminants may migrate from, within or through these properties. These releases or migrations may give rise to claims. Where third parties are responsible  for  contamination,  the  third  parties  may  not  have  funds,  or  not  make  funds  available  when  needed,  to  pay  remediation  costs  imposed  upon  the Company under environmental laws and regulations.

The Company is responsible for the maintenance of discontinued coal mining operations in Germany. The risk of environmental remediation exists, and the Company is in the process of remediating the mines considered to be the most at risk.

## 3) Financial Risks:

The Company's effective tax rate could materially increase as a consequence of various factors, including U.S. and/or international tax legislation, mix of the Company's earnings by jurisdiction, and U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictional tax audits.

The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions. Therefore, it is subject to changes in tax laws in each of these jurisdictions, including changes discussed in the paragraphs below. The outcome of these and other legislative developments, including changes to interpretations of recently enacted legislation, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future effective tax rate and cash flows.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ('OECD') has been working with a group of more than 100 countries to significantly change the tax  treatment  of  multinational  businesses,  subjecting  them  to  tax  in  additional  jurisdictions,  modifying  the  methods  by  which  they  allocate  profits  among jurisdictions, and subjecting them to a minimum level of tax of 15%, on a country-by-country-basis. As part of this effort, in December of 2021, the OECD published model rules to assist with implementation of the minimum tax regime.

In December of 2022, the European Union reached an agreement pursuant to which all European Union countries agreed to enact laws based upon the OECD-led minimum tax proposals. As of the end of 2023, many of the European Union countries have already enacted these rules effective for years beginning on or after December 31, 2023. Similar legislation was adopted, or is expected to be adopted, in other countries with widespread implementation of the global minimum tax anticipated by the end of 2025. The Company's income tax rate in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions is lower than 15%. Once these minimum tax rules are effective, they could have a significant adverse effect on the Company's future effective tax rate and cash flows.

The Company has two subsidiaries in China which benefit from lower income tax rates due to 'tax holidays' which apply for three-year periods. The tax holiday for one of the subsidiaries expired at the end of 2022 but was later extended for an additional three years, retroactive to include all of 2023, as well as 2024 and 2025,  and  for  the  other  subsidiary  the  tax  holiday  expired  at  the  end  of  2023.  Future  year  tax  benefits  will  depend  upon  the  Company's  ability  to  obtain extensions, after the three-year periods expire. There can be no assurance that future extensions will be granted.

The tax rates applicable in the jurisdictions within which the Company operates vary widely. Therefore, the Company's effective tax rate may be adversely affected by changes in the mix of its earnings by jurisdiction.

The Company's tax returns are subject to examination by various U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities, including the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. However, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations.

## Table of Contents

## The Company's ability to manage currency or commodity price fluctuations or supply shortages is limited.

As a resource-intensive manufacturing operation, the Company is exposed to a variety of market and asset risks, including the effects of changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. The Company has multiple sources of supply for the majority of its commodity requirements. The Company monitors and manages exposures in changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as an integral part of its overall risk  management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects on its results.  Nevertheless, changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates cannot always be predicted. In addition, because of intense price competition and the Company's high level of fixed costs, it may not be able to address such changes even if they are foreseeable. Substantial changes in these rates and prices could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. In addition, significant portions of its revenues and earnings are exposed to changes in foreign currency rates. As it operates in multiple foreign currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will impact its revenues and expenses. The impact of possible currency devaluation in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant exchange fluctuations can impact the  Company's  results  and  financial  guidance.  For  additional  discussion  of  interest  rate,  currency  or  commodity  price  risk,  see  Item  7A, Quantitative  and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk .

## A significant fluctuation between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the Company's revenue and earnings.

Although the Company's financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, the majority of the Company's operations consist of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign countries. The Company's most significant net long exposure is to the euro. The Company's most significant net short exposures are to the Chinese renminbi, Mexican peso, and Philippine peso. Changes in foreign exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

## The Company's revenues may vary significantly from period to period.

The Company's revenues may vary significantly from one period to another due to a variety of factors including:

- · changes in customers' buying decisions;
- · changes in demand for its products;
- · changes in its distributor inventory stocking;
- · the Company's product mix;
- · the Company's effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes;
- · costs and timing of its component purchases;
- · the effectiveness of its inventory control;
- · the degree to which it is able to utilize its available manufacturing capacity;
- · the Company's ability to meet delivery schedules;
- · general economic and industry conditions;
- · local conditions and events that may affect its production volumes, such as labor conditions and political instability; and
- · seasonality of certain product lines.

## Reorganization activities may lead to additional costs and material adverse effects.

In  the  past,  the  Company  has  taken  actions  to  restructure  and  optimize  its  production  and  manufacturing  capabilities  and  efficiencies  through  relocations, consolidations, plant closings or asset sales. In the future, the Company may take additional restructuring actions including the consolidating, closing or selling of additional facilities. These actions could result in impairment charges and various charges for such items as idle capacity, disposition costs and severance costs,  in  addition  to  normal  or  attendant  risks  and  uncertainties.  The  Company  may  be  unsuccessful  in  any  of  its  current  or  future  efforts  to  restructure  or consolidate its business. Plans to minimize or eliminate any loss of revenues during restructuring or consolidation may not be achieved. These activities may have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

A decline in expected profitability of the Company or individual reporting units of the Company could result in the impairment of assets, including goodwill and other long-lived assets.

## Table of Contents

The Company continues to hold material amounts of goodwill and other long-lived assets on its balance sheet. A decline in expected profitability, particularly if there  is  a  decline  in  the  global  economy,  could  call  into  question  the  recoverability  of  the  Company's  related  goodwill  and  other  long-lived  tangible  and intangible assets and require the write-down or write-off of these assets. Such an occurrence could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

## The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer could adversely affect the Company.

The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer could result in lower sales revenue and cause a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major auto manufacturer or significant supplier likely could lead to substantial disruptions in the automotive supply base, resulting in lower demand for the Company's products, which would likely cause a decrease in sales revenue and have a substantial adverse impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

## The inability to maintain access to capital markets may adversely affect the Company's business and financial results.

The Company's ability to invest in its businesses, make strategic acquisitions, and refinance maturing debt obligations may require access to the capital markets and  sufficient  bank  credit  lines  to  support  short-term  borrowings.  If  the  Company  is  unable  to  access  the  capital  markets  or  bank  credit  facilities,  it  could experience a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

## Fixed costs may reduce operating results if sales fall below expectations.

The Company's expense levels are based, in part, on its expectations for future sales. Many of the Company's expenses, particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead, are relatively fixed. The Company might not be able to reduce spending quickly enough to compensate for reductions in sales. Accordingly, shortfalls in sales could materially and adversely affect the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

## The volatility of the Company's stock price could affect the value of an investment in the Company's stock and future financial position.

The market price of the Company's stock can fluctuate widely. Between December 31, 2022 and December 30, 2023, the closing sale price of the Company's common stock ranged between a low of $212.8 and a high of $309.9. The volatility of the stock price may be related to any number of factors, such as volatility in the financial markets, general macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, market expectations concerning the Company's results of operations, or the volatility of its revenues as discussed above under 'The Company's revenues may vary significantly from period to period.' The historic market price of the Company's common stock may not be indicative of future market prices. The Company may not be able to sustain or increase the value of its common stock. Declines in the market price of the Company's stock could adversely affect the Company's ability to retain personnel with stock incentives, to acquire businesses or assets in exchange for stock and/or to conduct future financing activities with or involving the Company's common stock.

The Company is exposed to, and may be adversely affected by, potential security breaches or other disruptions to its information technology systems and data security.

## Table of Contents

The Company relies on its information technology systems and networks in connection with many of its business activities. Some of these networks and systems are  managed  directly  by  the  Company,  while  others  are  managed  by  third-party  service  providers  and  are  not  under  the  Company's  direct  control.  The Company's  operations  routinely  involve  receiving,  storing,  processing  and  transmitting  sensitive  information  pertaining  to  its  business,  customers,  dealers, suppliers, employees, and other sensitive matters. As with most companies, the Company has experienced cyber-attacks, attempts to breach its systems, and other similar incidents, none of which have been material. Any future cyber incidents could, however, materially disrupt operational systems; result in loss of trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information; compromise personally identifiable information regarding employees or customers or other third parties; and jeopardize the security of the Company's facilities. A cyber incident could be caused by malicious outsiders using sophisticated methods to circumvent firewalls, encryption, and other security defenses. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Information technology security threats, including security breaches, computer malware, and other cyber-attacks are increasing in both frequency and sophistication and could create financial liability, subject the Company to legal or regulatory sanctions or damage the Company's reputation with customers, dealers, suppliers, and other stakeholders. The Company continuously seeks to maintain a robust program of information security and controls, but the  impact  of  a  material  information  technology  event  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company's  competitive  position,  reputation,  results  of operations, financial position and cash flows.

## Customer demands and regulations related to conflict-free minerals may force the Company to incur additional expenses.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires disclosure of use of 'conflict' minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and efforts to prevent the use of such minerals. In the semiconductor industry, these minerals are most commonly found in metals. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering 'conflict free' metals, the Company cannot be certain that it will be able to obtain necessary metals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, the Company may face challenges with its customers and suppliers if it is unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in its products are 'conflict free.'

## ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.

None.

## ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY.

The cybersecurity and data protection program at Littelfuse is based on foundational principles outlined in applicable industry and internationally acceptedcybersecurity  frameworks.  The  Company  has  experienced  and  will  continue  to  experience  cyber-attacks,  attempts  to  breach  its  systems,  and  other  similar incidents, however we do not believe that the prior cyber incidents have materially affected or currently are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company. Littelfuse faces risks from cybersecurity threats that could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or reputation. Like all cybersecurity programs, there is no guarantee that every attack method and technique has been fully addressed, as these change constantly, but Littelfuse is diligent in its attempts to protect data of the Company and its stakeholders.

Littelfuse strives to assess and update its cybersecurity program on a regular basis using an Information Security Management System (ISMS) comprised of three main  elements  -  1)  independent  internationally  recognized  vendors  and  technologies  for  assessments  and  monitoring,  2)  strong  internal  controls  based  on industry standards, and 3) Board and Senior Leadership governance and support.

From an external assessment and monitoring perspective, Littelfuse engages third parties to monitor and report on known exploitable vulnerabilities, within and external to Littelfuse's information technology (IT) ecosystems. These third parties provide assessment and vulnerability scanning tools to detect exploitable unauthorized access into the Littelfuse environments.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is tasked with reviewing the Company's policies and procedures related to cybersecurity risks and incidents. The Company's Chief Information Officer ('CIO') oversees its cybersecurity program, and regularly provides updates to Littelfuse Senior Leadership and the Audit Committee, as well as the full Board, which include information regarding our cybersecurity program initiatives, insurance coverage, acquisition integration processes, program performance as well as the maturity of the Littelfuse cybersecurity program. These cybersecurity maturity updates are based on cybersecurity maturity reporting and analysis by the Littelfuse internal IT team, as well as reporting provided by independent third parties. The updates help Senior Leadership, the Audit Committee, and the Board to understand the risks the organization faces based on changing cybersecurity threats and on changes to the Littelfuse environment due to factors such as acquisitions

and new technology upgrades and improvements. Representatives from Littelfuse's technology team and other business functions receive regular cybersecurity risk reports and use this information for its decision making in operational improvements as well as budget and resource allocations. The CIO has managed and evolved the cyber security function at Littelfuse for the past five years and is supported by a cyber security leader with over 20 years of Littelfuse experience in IT infrastructure, IT operations, and cybersecurity.

The  ISMS  within  Littelfuse  consists  of  internationally  recognized  program  elements  that  reduce  the  risk  of  an  operational  or  cybersecurity  incident  from significantly impacting Littelfuse and its customers, vendors, and employees. These ISMS elements include but are not limited to:

Security Awareness and Training - Littelfuse has an IT security awareness program consisting of training on the fundamentals of information security protection. These training courses are provided annually.

Network Protection - Network protection, detection, and monitoring technologies have been deployed on all external and internal network connections to segment different sections of the business from each other to strengthen key protection capabilities.

Identity and Access Management (IAM) - Littelfuse has implemented user authentication controls on its systems, devices, data, and applications. In addition, multi-factor authentication is implemented for all personnel who remotely access or have privileged account access to Littelfuse systems and networks.

Data  Classification  and  Protection -  Littelfuse  has  implemented  data  loss  prevention  and  classification  labels  and  encryption  on  its  internal unstructured data to prevent unauthorized data loss and data sharing. Structured data in ERP systems and core business systems are encrypted and protected by industry cybersecurity standards and procedures.

Endpoint Protection Littelfuse has implemented anti-virus, malware, and endpoint protection management detection and monitoring solutions on end-user devices and servers. Logs and alerts from these monitoring solutions are routed to independent third-party monitoring vendors that provide 24/7 monitoring, around the world.

Threat and Vulnerability Management - Littelfuse uses an internationally recognized managed security services provider (MSSP) and technologies to collect  security  alert  and  audit  logs  on  a  24/7  basis,  monitor  and  assess  latest  threat  intelligence,  provide  analysis  on  new  identified  potential vulnerabilities, and provide response and support services to rapidly reduce any identified vulnerabilities.

Security Incident Management - Security incident response plans and procedures have been developed in collaboration with our MSSP. They allow us  to  assess  potential  threats,  first  and  second  level  notification  and  response  protocols,  and  supporting  notification  protocols  -  both  internally  and externally. These plans, procedures, and protocols are tested and updated on a regular basis.

Resiliency and Contingency Planning - Risk assessments are performed on a regular basis to assess the IT risk of single points of failure, security maturity,  and  security  vulnerabilities.  The  results  of  these  assessments  are  used  to  define  various  resiliency  and  contingency  mitigation  strategies, corrective action plans, on-site and remote data back-up strategies and technologies and allocation of IT resources.

## ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

The Company's engineering and research and development, manufacturing, sales, warehouses, and distribution centers are located in approximately 76 owned or leased facilities worldwide with primary operations in China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Mexico, Netherlands, Philippines, South Korea, Spain, U.K, the U.S., and Vietnam totaling approximately 5.0 million square feet. The Company's owned facilities include approximately 2.6 million square feet and the Company's leased facilities include approximately 2.4 million square feet. The Company's corporate headquarters is located in the U.S. in Chicago, Illinois.

The Company believes its facilities are adequate to meet its requirements for the foreseeable future.

## 2023 EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

Net sales were $2,362.7 million, which decreased by $151.2 million or 6.0% in 2023 compared to 2022 including $0.7 million favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volume in the Electronics segment and the commercial vehicle business within the Transportation segment that more than offset $91.9 million or 3.7% of incremental net sales from the C&amp;K acquisition within the Electronics segment and $13.2 million or 0.5% of  net  sales  from  the  Western Automation  acquisition  within  the  Industrial  segment. The  Company  recognized  net  income  of  $259.5  million,  or  $10.34  per diluted share, in 2023 compared to net income of $373.3 million, or $14.94 per diluted share in 2022. The decrease in net income was primarily due to lower operating  income  of  $131.0  million  in  the  Electronics  segment  and  $29.9  million  in  the  Transportation  segment  mainly  driven  by  the  commercial  vehicle business.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $457.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 representing an increase of $37.7 million as compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to reductions in working capital partially offset by lower cash earnings.

On June 28, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire a 200mm wafer fab located in Dortmund, Germany ('Dortmund Fab') from Elmos Semiconductor SE. The acquisition of the Dortmund Fab is expected to close in early fiscal year 2025. The total purchase price for the fab is approximately 93 million Euro, of which 37.2 million Euro down payment (approximately $40.5 million) was made with cash on hand and recorded in Other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was paid in the third quarter after regulatory approvals and approximately 56 million Euro will be paid at closing. The transaction did not have a material impact on the Company's fiscal year 2023 financial results and is not expected to have material impact on the Company's 2024 financial results and will be reported in the semiconductor business within the Company's Electronics segment.

On February 3, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Western Automation for approximately $162 million in cash. Headquartered in Galway, Ireland, Western Automation is a designer and manufacturer of electrical shock protection devices used across a broad range of high-growth end markets, including eMobility  off-board  charging  infrastructure,  industrial  safety  and  renewables. At  the  time  the  Company  and  Western Automation  entered  into  the  definitive agreement, Western Automation had annualized sales of approximately $25 million. The business is reported within the Company's Industrial segment. The Company financed the transaction with cash on hand.

## Risks Related to Market Conditions

The Company continues to operate in a challenging macro environment, including but not limited to, supply chain disruptions, varying regional dynamics, and some pockets  of  end  market  softness.  The  ongoing  war  in  Ukraine  has  had  a  minimal  impact  on  the  Company,  as  the  Company  suspended  sales  into  and purchases from Russia. The Company does not have any direct operations in Ukraine or Russia.

## Critical Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies

The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principle  ("GAAP")  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company's most critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations, and which require the Company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company has identified the following as its most critical accounting policies and judgments. Although management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information available when they are made, and therefore, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors. Significant accounting policies are more fully described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

## Critical Accounting Estimates

## Goodwill

The Company's methodology for allocating the purchase price of acquisitions is based on established valuation techniques that reflect the consideration of a number of factors, including valuations performed by third-party appraisers when appropriate. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value assigned to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Based on its current organization structure, the Company has seven reporting units for which cash flows are determinable and to which goodwill has been allocated.

The Company annually tests goodwill for impairment on the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company also performs an interim review for indicators of impairment each quarter to assess whether an interim impairment review is required for any reporting unit. As part of its interim reviews, management analyzes potential changes in the value of individual reporting units based on each reporting unit's operating results for the period compared to expected results as of the prior year's annual impairment test. In addition, management considers how other key assumptions, including discount rates and expected long-term growth rates, used in the last annual impairment test, could be impacted by changes in market conditions and economic events.

There were no impairment charges recorded during the fiscal years of 2023, 2022 and 2021.

## Quantitative Assessment for Impairment

For the seven reporting units with goodwill, the Company compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value, the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value is recorded as the amount of the goodwill impairment charge. The results of the goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2023 indicated that the estimated fair values for each of the seven reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values. Accordingly, there were no goodwill impairment charges recorded as part of the Company's 2023 annual goodwill impairment test.

As  part  of  its  impairment  test  for  these  reporting  units,  the  Company  engaged  a  third-party  appraisal  firm  to  assist  in  the  Company's  determination  of  the estimated fair values. This determination included estimating the fair value of each reporting unit using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, discount rates and the allocation of shared or corporate items. The market approach estimates fair values using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping. The Company weighted both the income and market approach equally to estimate the concluded fair value of each reporting unit. The determination of fair value requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions, which primarily include, but are  not  limited  to:  the  selection  of  appropriate  peer  group  companies;  control  premiums  appropriate  for  acquisitions  in  which  the  Company  competes;  the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures.

## Goodwill Impairment Assumptions

Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of the reporting units. Future declines in the overall market value of the Company's equity may also result in a conclusion that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.

One measure of the sensitivity of the amount of goodwill impairment charges to key assumptions is the amount by which each reporting unit 'passed' (fair value exceeds the carrying value) the goodwill impairment test. All seven of the reporting units passed the goodwill impairment test, with fair values that exceeded the carrying values between 23% and 369% of their respective estimated fair values. As of the most recent annual test conducted on October 1, 2023, the Company noted  that  the  excess  of  fair  value  over  the  carrying  value  was  110%,  80%,  126%,  47%,  58%,  23%,  and  369%  for  its  reporting  units:  Electronics-Passive Products and Sensors, Electronics-Semiconductor, Passenger Car Products, Commercial Vehicle Products, Automotive Sensors, Industrial Controls and Sensors, and Industrial Circuit Protection, respectively. Relatively small changes in the Company's key assumptions would not have resulted in any reporting units failing the goodwill impairment test.

Generally, changes in estimates of expected future cash flows would have a similar effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. That is, a 1.0% decrease in estimated annual future cash flows would decrease the estimated fair value of the reporting unit by approximately 1.0%. The estimated long-term net sales growth rate can have a significant impact on the estimated future cash flows, and therefore, the fair value of each reporting unit. A 1.0% decrease in the long-term net sales growth rate would have resulted in no reporting units failing the goodwill impairment test. Of the other key assumptions that impact the estimated fair values, most reporting units have the greatest sensitivity to changes in the estimated discount rate. The estimated discount rate was 12.6% for the

Electronics-Passive  Products  and  Sensors,  Electronics-Semiconductor,  Passenger  Car  Products,  Commercial  Vehicle  Products,  Automotive  Sensors,  and Industrial Circuit Protection reporting units, and 16.8% for the Industrial Controls and Sensors reporting unit. A 1.0% increase in the estimated discount rates would have resulted in no reporting units failing the annual goodwill impairment test. The Company believes that its estimates of future cash flows and discount rates are reasonable, but future changes in the underlying assumptions could differ due to the inherent uncertainty in making such estimates. Additionally, price deterioration or lower volume could have a significant impact on the fair values of the reporting units.

## Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred taxes are recognized for the future effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company recognizes deferred taxes for temporary differences, operating loss carryforwards and tax credit and other tax attribute carryforwards (excluding carryforwards where usage has been determined to be remote). Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. U.S. state and non-U.S. income taxes are provided on the portion of non-U.S. income that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable (and non-U.S. income taxes are provided on the portion of non-U.S. income that is expected to be remitted to an upper-tier non-U.S. entity). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

Deferred  income  taxes  are  not  provided  on  the  excess  of  the  investment  value  for  financial  reporting  over  the  tax  basis  of  investments  in  those  non-U.S. subsidiaries for which such excess is considered to be permanently reinvested in those operations. Management regularly evaluates whether non-U.S. earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested. This evaluation requires judgment about the future operating and liquidity needs of the Company and its non-U.S. subsidiaries. Changes in economic and business conditions, non-U.S. or U.S. tax laws, or the Company's financial situation could result in changes to these judgments and the need to record additional tax liabilities.

The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), among other things, imposed a one-time tax (the 'Toll Charge') on accumulated earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries and included base broadening provisions commonly referred to as the global intangible low-taxed income provisions ("GILTI").

In accordance with guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") staff, the Company has adopted an accounting policy to treat any GILTI inclusions as a period cost if and when incurred. Thus, for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022, and January 1, 2022, deferred taxes were computed without consideration of the possible future impact of the GILTI provisions, and any current year impact was recorded as a part of the current portion of income tax expense.

Further information regarding income taxes, including a detailed reconciliation of current year activity, is provided in Note 14, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.

## Revenue Recognition

The  Company  recognizes  revenue  on  product  sales  in  the  period  in  which  the  Company  satisfies  its  performance  obligation  and  control  of  the  product  is transferred  to  the  customer. The  Company's sales arrangements with customers are predominately short term in nature and generally provide for transfer of control at the time of shipment as this is the point at which title and risk of loss of the product transfers to the customer. At the end of each period, for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer, the Company adjusts revenues and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when they are received by the customer. The amount of revenue recorded reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for goods and may include adjustments for customer allowance, rebates and price adjustments. The Company's sales channels are primarily through direct sales and independent third-party distributors.

The Company has elected the practical expedient under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 340-40-25-4 to expense commissions when incurred as the amortization period of the commission asset the Company would have otherwise recognized is less than one year.

## Revenue and Billing

The Company generally accepts orders from customers through receipt of purchase orders or electronic data interchange based on written sales agreements and purchasing  contracts.  Contract  pricing  and  selling  agreement  terms  are  based  on  market  factors,  costs,  and  competition.  Pricing  is  often  negotiated  as  an adjustment (premium or discount) from the Company's published price lists. The customer is invoiced when the Company's products are shipped to them in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement. As the Company's standard payment terms are less than one year, the Company has elected the practical expedient under ASC 606-10-32-18 to not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component. The Company also elected the practical expedient provided  in  ASC  606-10-25-18B  to  treat  all  product  shipping  and  handling  activities  as  fulfillment  activities,  and  therefore  recognize  the  gross  revenue associated with the contract, inclusive of any shipping and handling revenue.

## Ship and Debit Program

Some of the terms of the Company's sales agreements and normal business conditions provide customers (distributors) the ability to receive price adjustments on products previously shipped and invoiced. This practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a 'ship and debit' program. This program allows the distributor  to  debit  the  Company  for  the  difference  between  the  distributors'  contracted  price  and  a  lower  price  for  specific  transactions.  Under  certain circumstances (usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity), a distributor will request authorization for pricing allowances to reduce its price. When the Company approves such a reduction, the distributor is authorized to 'debit' its account for the difference between the contracted price and the lower approved price. The Company establishes reserves for this program based on historic activity, distributor inventory levels and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these debits as a reduction of revenue.

## Return to Stock

The  Company  has  a  return  to  stock  policy  whereby  certain  customers,  with  prior  authorization  from  the  Company's  management,  can  return  previously purchased goods for full or partial credit. The Company establishes an estimated allowance for these returns based on historic activity. Sales revenue and cost of sales are reduced to anticipate estimated returns.

## Volume Rebates

The Company offers volume-based sales incentives to certain customers to encourage greater product sales. If customers achieve their specific quarterly or annual sales targets, they are entitled to rebates. The Company estimates the projected amount of rebates that will be achieved by the customer and recognizes this estimated cost as a reduction to revenue as products are sold.

## Allowance for Credit Losses

The Company currently measures the expected credit losses based on our historical credit loss experience. The Company has not experienced significant recent or  historical  credit  losses  and  is  not  forecasting  any  significant  credit  losses  which  would  require  adjustments  to  our  methodology.  If  current  conditions  and supportable forecasts indicate that our historical loss experience is not reasonable and no longer supportable, the Company may adjust its historical credit loss experience and to reflect these conditions and forecasts. The Company regularly analyzes its significant customer accounts and, when the Company becomes aware of a customer's inability to meet its financial obligations, the Company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes is collectible. The Company also analyzes all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, macroeconomic considerations and historical collection and loss experience. Historically, the allowance for credit losses has been adequate to cover bad debts. If circumstances related to specific customers change, the estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.

## Inventory

The Company performs regular detailed assessments of inventory, which include a review of, among other factors, demand requirements, product life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, shelf life, and quality issues. Based on the analysis, the Company records adjustments to inventory for  excess  quantities,  obsolescence  or  impairment  when  appropriate  to  reflect  inventory  at  net  realizable  value.  Historically,  inventory  reserves  have  been adequate to reflect inventory at net realizable value.

## Long-Lived Assets

The Company evaluates the recoverability of other long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and certain identifiable intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Factors which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business, a significant decrease in the market value of the assets or significant negative industry or economic trends. When the Company determines that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the indicators, the assets are assessed for impairment based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value. For the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, the Company recognized a $3.9 million impairment charge related to the land and building of a property in the  commercial  vehicle  business  within  the  Transportation  segment  that  the  Company  made  the  decision  to  donate,  a  $0.9  million  impairment  charge substantially related to certain patents in a business within the Industrial segment, and a $0.1 million impairment on certain machinery and equipment in the semiconductor  business  within  the  Electronics  segment.  For  the  fiscal  year  ended  December  31,  2022,  the  Company  recorded  a  $2.9  million  non-cash impairment charge for certain acquired technology and patent intangible assets due to a change in use and projected cash flows within the Electronics segment. Additionally, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.7 million for certain machinery and equipment within the Electronics segment due to a decision to cease further production of a product line during the fourth quarter of 2022.

## Environmental Liabilities

Environmental liabilities are accrued based on estimates of the probability of potential future environmental exposure. Costs related to on-going maintenance of environmental sites are expensed as incurred. If actual or estimated probable future losses exceed the Company's recorded liability for such claims, it would record additional charges as other expense during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. The Company evaluates its reserve for coal mine remediation annually utilizing a third-party expert.

## Pension Plans

The Company records annual income and expense amounts relating to its pension and postretirement benefits plans based on calculations which include various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, expected long-term rates of return and compensation increases. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis as of the fiscal year-end balance sheet date (or more frequently if a significant event requiring remeasurement occurs) and modifies the assumption based on current rates and trends when it is appropriate to do so. The effects of modifications are recognized immediately on the Consolidated Balance Sheets but are generally amortized into operating earnings over future periods, with the deferred amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience, market conditions and input from its actuaries and investment advisors. The Company maintains several pension plans in international locations. The expected returns on plan assets  and  discount  rates  are  determined  based  on  each  plan's  investment  approach,  local  interest  rates  and  plan  participant  profiles.  The  weighted-average discount rates for the Company's defined benefit plans primarily in Europe and the Asia-Pacific regions at December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were 5.6% and 5.8%, respectively.

A 50 basis point change in the discount rates at December 30, 2023 would have the following effect on the projected benefit obligation:

| (in millions)                | 0.5% Increase   |   0.5% Decrease |
|------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Projected benefit obligation | $ (3.8)         |             4.1 |

## Equity-based Compensation

Equity-based compensation expense is recorded for stock-option awards and restricted share units based upon the fair values of the awards. The fair value of stock-option awards is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which includes assumptions for volatility, expected term, riskfree interest rate and dividend yield. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on Littelfuse stock, historical volatility of Littelfuse stock and other factors. Historical data is used to estimate employee termination experience and the expected term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The Company initiated a quarterly cash dividend in 2010 and expects to continue making cash dividend payments for the foreseeable future. The fair value of restricted share units is determined based on the Company's stock price on the grant date reduced by the present value of expected dividends through the vesting period.

Total  equity-based  compensation  expense  for  all  equity  compensation  plans  was  $25.7  million,  $24.6  million,  and  $21.4  million  in  2023,  2022,  and  2021, respectively. Further information regarding this expense is provided in Note 12, Stock-Based Compensation , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.

In the financial review that follows, the Company discusses its consolidated results of operations, financial position, cash flows and certain other information. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes.

## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 30, 2023 AS COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022

Fiscal year 2023 included $28.2 million of non-segment charges, of which $11.7 million related to legal and professional fees and other integration expenses related  to  completed  and  contemplated  acquisitions  and  $16.5  million  of  restructuring,  impairment  and  other  charges,  primarily  associated  with  employee termination costs and a $3.9 million impairment charge for the land and building in the commercial vehicle business within the Transportation segment. See Note 8, Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges, for further discussion.

Fiscal year 2022 included $43.2 million of non-segment charges, of which $17.6 million related to legal and professional fees and other integration expenses primarily  associated  with  the  C&amp;K  and  Carling  acquisitions  and  other  contemplated  acquisitions,  $15.6  million  of  purchase  accounting  inventory  step-up charges, and $10.0 million of restructuring, impairment and other charges, primarily related to employee termination costs and a $2.9 million intangible asset impairment  charge  within  the  Electronics  segment  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2022.  See  Note  8, Restructuring,  Impairment  and  Other  Charges, for  further discussion.

Fiscal  year  2023  also  included  approximately  $12.3  million  in  foreign  currency  exchange  losses  primarily  attributable  to  changes  in  the  value  of  the  Euro, Sterling,  and  Chinese  renminbi  against  the  U.S.  dollar,  while  fiscal  year  2022  included  approximately  $24.4  million  in  foreign  currency  exchange  losses primarily attributable to changes in the value of the Euro, Philippine peso, Sterling, and Chinese renminbi against the U.S. dollar.

## Net Sales

Net sales were $2,362.7 million, which decreased by $151.2 million, or 6.0% compared to 2022, including $0.7 million of favorable changes in foreign exchange rates for 2023 compared to 2022. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower volume in the Electronics segment and the commercial vehicle business within the Transportation segment that more than offset $105.1 million or 4.2% of incremental net sales from the C&amp;K and Western Automation acquisitions and higher volume from the Industrial segment.

## Table of Contents

## Cost of Sales

Cost of sales was $1,462.4 million, or 61.9% of net sales, in 2023, compared to $1,507.0 million, or 59.9% of net sales, in 2022. As a percent of net sales, cost of sales increased 2.0% driven by lower volume in the Electronics segment and the commercial vehicle business within the Transportation segment, partially offset by volume leverage and favorable product mix from the Industrial segment compared to 2022, and $15.6 million or 0.6% of purchase accounting inventory charges recorded during 2022.

Gross profit was $900.2 million, or 38.1% of net sales, in 2023, compared to $1,006.9 million, or 40.1% of net sales, in 2022. The $106.7 million decrease in gross profit was primarily due to lower volume in the Electronics segment and the commercial vehicle business within the Transportation segment, partially offset by the acquisition of C&amp;K within the Electronics segment, and volume leverage and favorable product mix from the Industrial segment and $15.6 million or 0.6% of purchase accounting inventory charges recorded during the first nine months of 2022.

## Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses were $539.4 million, or 22.8% of net sales, for 2023 compared to $506.1 million, or 20.1% of net sales, for 2022. The increase in operating expenses of $33.3 million was primarily due to higher selling, general, and administrative expenses of $9.8 million, higher amortization expense of $10.1 million and research and development expenses of $6.8 million mainly due to the C&amp;K and Western Automation acquisitions. Additionally, the Company incurred an increase in restructuring, impairment, and other charges of $6.5 million primarily related to the reorganization of certain manufacturing, selling and administrative functions within the Transportation and Industrial segments and a $3.9 million impairment charge related to the land and building of a property in the  commercial  vehicle  business  within  the  Transportation  segment.  This  increase  in  operating  expenses  was  partially  offset  by  lower  variable  incentive compensation expense.

## Operating Income

Operating income for 2023 was $360.9 million, a decrease of $140.0 million or 27.9% compared to $500.8 million for 2022. The decrease in operating income was due to lower gross profit from the Electronics and Transportation segments and higher operating expenses as noted above. Operating margins decreased from 19.9% in 2022 to 15.3% in 2023 primarily driven by lower volume in the Electronics and Transportation segments and the higher operating expenses mentioned above.

## Income Before Income Taxes

Income before income taxes for 2023 was $328.6 million, or 13.9% of net sales compared to $443.0 million, or 17.6% of net sales, for 2022. In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income discussed above, income before income taxes was primarily benefited by lower foreign exchange losses of $12.1 million and lower unrealized losses of $13.7 million related to one of the Company's equity investments for 2023 compared to 2022.

## Income Taxes

Income tax expense for 2023 was $69.1 million, or an effective tax rate of 21.0%, compared to income tax expense of $69.7 million, or an effective tax rate of 15.7% for 2022. The effective tax rate for 2023 is higher than the effective tax rate for 2022, primarily due to less income earned in lower tax jurisdictions in 2023, as well as one-time tax benefits in 2022 resulting from losses on investments in the stock of two of the Company's affiliates. The effective tax rate for 2022 was lower than the applicable U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to income earned in lower tax jurisdictions as well as the impact of the one-time deductions previously noted. Further information regarding these items is provided in Note 14, Income Taxes , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash and cash equivalents were $555.5 million as of December 30, 2023, a decrease of $7.1 million as compared to December 31, 2022.

As of December 30, 2023, $376.9 million of the Company's $555.5 million cash and cash equivalents was held by non-U.S. subsidiaries. Of the $376.9 million, at  least  $214.3  million  can  be  repatriated  with  minimal  tax  consequences,  although  in  certain  cases  a  non-U.S.  withholding  tax  would  be  payable  but subsequently refunded. With respect to the remaining $162.6 million, the Company has recognized deferred tax liabilities on approximately $106.3 million as of December 30, 2023 because the amounts are not considered to be permanently reinvested, and the Company may access additional amounts through loans and other means. Repatriation of some non-U.S. cash balances is restricted by local laws. Management regularly evaluates whether foreign earnings are expected to be  permanently  reinvested.  This  evaluation  requires  judgment  about  the  future  operating  and  liquidity  needs  of  the  Company  and  its  foreign  subsidiaries. Changes in economic and business conditions and tax laws could result in changes to these judgments and the need to record additional tax liabilities.

The Company has historically supported its liquidity needs through cash flows from operations. Management expects that the Company's (i) current level of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, (ii) current and forecasted cash flows from operations, (iii) availability under existing funding arrangements, and (iv) access to capital in the capital markets will provide sufficient funds to support the Company's operations, capital expenditures, investments, and debt obligations on both a short-term and long-term basis.

## Revolving Credit Facility

On June 30, 2022, the Company amended and restated its Credit Agreement, dated as of April 3, 2020 (as so amended and restated, the 'Credit Agreement') to effect  certain  changes,  including,  among  other  changes:  (i)  adding  a  $300  million  unsecured  term  loan  credit  facility;  (ii)  making  certain  financial  and  nonfinancial covenants less restrictive on the Company and its subsidiaries; (iii) replacing LIBOR-based interest rate benchmarks and modifying performance-based interest rate margins; and (iv) extending the maturity date to June 30, 2027 (the 'Maturity Date'). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company may, from time to time, increase the size of the revolving credit facility or enter into one or more tranches of term loans in minimum increments of $25 million if there is no event of default and the Company is in compliance with certain financial covenants.

Loans made under the available credit facility pursuant to the Credit Agreement ("the Credit Facility") bear interest at the Company's option, at either Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), fixed for interest periods of one, two, three or six-month periods, plus 1.00% to 1.75%, plus a SOFR adjustment of 0.10% or at the bank's Base Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus 0.00% to 0.75%, based upon the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Company is also required to pay commitment fees on unused portions of the Credit Facility ranging from 0.10% to 0.175%, based on the Consolidated  Leverage  Ratio,  as  defined  in  the  Credit Agreement.  The  Credit Agreement  includes  representations,  covenants  and  events  of  default  that  are customary for financing transactions of this nature.

Under the Credit Agreement, revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until the Maturity Date, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid.  The  Company  borrowed  $300.0  million  under  a  term  loan  on  June  30,  2022.  The  principal  balance  of  the  term  loans  must  be  repaid  in  quarterly installments on the last day of each calendar quarter in the amount of $1.9 million commencing September 30, 2022, through June 30, 2024, and in the amount of $3.8 million commencing September 30, 2024, through March 31, 2027, with the remaining outstanding principal balance payable in full on the Maturity Date. Accrued interest on the loans is payable in arrears on each interest payment date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified in the Credit Agreement. Subject to certain conditions, (i) the Company may terminate or reduce the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, as defined in the Credit Agreement, in whole or in part, and (ii) the Company may prepay the revolving loans or the term loans at any time, without premium or penalty. During the fiscal year ended December  30,  2023,  the  Company  made  term  loan  payments  of  $7.5  million.  The  revolving  loan  and  term  loan  balance  under  the  Credit  Facility  was $100.0 million and $288.8 million, respectively, as of December 30, 2023.

On May 12, 2022, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage interest rate risk exposure, effectively converting the interest rate on the Company's SOFR based floating-rate loans to a fixed-rate. The interest rate swap, with a notional value of $200 million, was designated as a cash flow hedge against the variability of cash flows associated with the Company's SOFR based loans scheduled to mature on June 30, 2027.

As of December 30, 2023, the effective interest rate on unhedged portion of the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility was 6.71%, and 4.13% on the hedged portion.

## ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices.

## Interest Rate Risk

On June 30, 2022, the Company amended and restated its Credit Agreement, dated as of April 3, 2020 to effect certain changes, including, among other changes: (i) adding a $300 million unsecured term loan credit facility; (ii) making certain financial and non-financial covenants less restrictive on the Company and its subsidiaries; (iii) replacing LIBOR-based interest rate benchmarks and modifying performance-based interest rate margins; and (iv) extending the maturity date to June 30, 2027 (the 'Maturity Date'). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company may, from time to time, increase the size of the revolving credit facility or enter into one or more tranches of term loans in minimum increments of $25 million if there is no event of default and the Company is in compliance with certain financial covenants.

The revolving loan and term loan balance under the Credit Facility was $100.0 million and $288.8 million, respectively, as of December 30, 2023. On May 12, 2022, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage interest rate risk exposure, effectively converting the interest rate on the Company's SOFR based floating-rate loans to a fixed-rate. The interest rate swap, with a notional value of $200 million, was designated as a cash flow hedge against the variability of cash flows associated with the Company's SOFR based loans scheduled to mature on June 30, 2027. The cash flow hedge reduces the Company exposure to future interest rate fluctuation. After consideration of the hedge above, the remaining borrowings of $188.8 million, which represents approximately 20% of the Company's total debt, is subject to future interest rate fluctuations which could potentially have a negative impact on the Company's cash flows. A prospective  increase  of  100  basis  points  in  the  interest  rate  applicable  to  the  Company's  outstanding  borrowings  under  its  credit  facility  would  result  in  an increase  of  approximately  $1.9  million  in  annual  interest  expense.  This  exposure  would  be  partially  if  not  fully  offset  by  higher  interest  income  from  the Company's investments.

## Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

The majority of the Company's operations consist of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign countries. The Company has operations in China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Mexico, Philippines, U.K., Japan, Lithuania, Netherlands, Portugal, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, U.S., and Vietnam. During 2023, sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 65% of total net sales. During 2022, sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 64% of total net sales. Substantially all sales in Europe are denominated in euros and substantially all sales in the Asia-Pacific region are denominated in U.S. dollars, Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, or Korean won.

The Company's foreign exchange exposures result  primarily  from  inter-company  loans,  external  borrowings,  sale  of  products  in  foreign  currencies,  foreign currency denominated purchases, employee-related and other costs of running operations in foreign countries. The Company's most significant foreign currency exposures are to the euro, the Chinese renminbi, Mexican peso, and Philippine peso. Changes in foreign exchange rates could affect the Company's sales, costs, balance sheet values and earnings.

At December 30, 2023, the net value of the Company's assets with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately $38 million, with the largest exposure being  a  Japanese  Yen  denominated  inter-company  loan  with  a  U.S.  Dollars  functional  currency  subsidiary.  The  reduction  in  earnings  from  a  hypothetical instantaneous  10%  adverse  change  in  quoted  foreign  currency  spot  rates  applied  to  foreign  currency  sensitive  asset  instruments  would  be  $3.8  million  at December 30, 2023. At December 30, 2023, the net value of the Company's liabilities with exposure to foreign currency risk was $6.5 million, with the largest exposure being U.S. Dollar denominated inter-company loans with a Mexican Peso functional currency subsidiary. The reduction in earnings from a hypothetical instantaneous 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency spot rates applied to foreign currency sensitive liability instruments would be $0.6 million at December 30, 2023. As a result of the mix in currencies impacting the hypothetical 10% changes, the movements in some instruments would offset movements in other instruments reducing the hypothetical exposure to the Company.

## Commodity Price Risk

The Company uses various metals in the manufacturing of its products, including copper, zinc, tin, gold, and silver. Prices of these and other commodities can rise and result in materially higher costs of producing our products. The Company believes it has adequate primary and secondary sources of supply for each of our key materials. While the Company is exposed to significant changes in certain metal prices and expects higher material costs, the Company actively monitors these exposures, has taken and may take various actions in the future, including price increases and productivity improvements to mitigate any negative impacts of these exposures.

## Opinion on the financial statements

We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  Littelfuse,  Inc.  (a  Delaware  corporation)  and  subsidiaries  (the  'Company')  as  of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the related consolidated statements of net income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule included under Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the  'financial  statements').  In  our  opinion,  the  financial  statements  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial  position  of  the  Company  as  of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ('PCAOB'), the Company's internal control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  30,  2023,  based  on  criteria  established  in  the  2013  Internal  Control-Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ('COSO'), and our report dated February 16, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion.

## Basis for opinion

These  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  Company's  financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

## Critical audit matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be  communicated  to  the  audit  committee  and  that:  (1)  relates  to  accounts  or  disclosures  that  are  material  to  the  financial  statements  and  (2)  involved  our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

## Business Acquisition - Western Automation - Valuation of acquired intangible assets

As discussed in Note 2, the Company acquired Western Automation ('Western Automation'), on February 3, 2023 for a total purchase price of approximately $158 million, net of cash acquired. The Company allocated the purchase price, on a preliminary basis, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, including identified intangible assets of $68 million. We identified the valuation of acquired Western Automation intangible assets as a critical audit matter.

The  principal  considerations  for  our  determination  that  the  valuation  of  acquired  Western Automation  intangible  assets  is  a  critical  audit  matter  are  (i)  the significant judgment by management when determining assumptions used in the fair value measurement of acquired intangible assets (ii) the high degree of auditor  judgment  and  subjectivity  in  performing  procedures  and  evaluating  management's  significant  assumptions  relating  to  the  projected  forecasted information including revenue growth rate, weighted average cost of capital (WACC), royalty rate, and customer attrition rate and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.

## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

## Table of Contents

Our audit procedures related to the valuation of the acquired intangible assets included the following, among others:

- · we tested the design and operating effectiveness of the controls over the Company's acquisition and valuation process, including review of the valuation model, significant assumptions used, and the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used
- · we  tested  the  projected  financial  information  including  forecasted  revenue  growth  rate  by  assessing  the  reasonableness  of  management's  forecasts compared to historical results and forecasted industry trends
- · with  the  assistance  of  our  valuation  specialists,  we  assessed  the  assumptions  and  methodologies  used  in  developing  the  WACC,  royalty  rates,  and customer attrition rates by developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the rates selected by management. We also involved our valuation specialists to evaluate the assumptions and methodologies used in valuing the intangible assets.

## Opinion on internal control over financial reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Littelfuse, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the 'Company') as of December 30, 2023, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ('COSO'). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO.

We also  have  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States)  ('PCAOB'),  the  consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 30, 2023, and our report dated February 16, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

## Basis for opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  the  accompanying  Management's  Report  on  Internal  Control  over  Financial  Reporting  ('Management's Report'). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards  of  the  PCAOB. Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

## Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A  company's  internal  control  over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements. Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Information

## Nature of Operations

Littelfuse, Inc. and subsidiaries (the 'Company') is a diversified, industrial technology manufacturing company empowering a sustainable, connected, and safer world. Across more than 20 countries, and with approximately 17,000 global associates, the Company partners with customers to design and deliver innovative, reliable solutions. Serving over 100,000 end customers, the Company's products are found in a variety of industrial, transportation and electronics end markets everywhere, every day.

## Fiscal Year

References herein to '2023', 'fiscal 2023' or 'fiscal year 2023' refer to the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. References herein to '2022', 'fiscal 2022' or 'fiscal year 2022' refer to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. References herein to '2021', 'fiscal 2021' or 'fiscal year 2021' refer to the fiscal year ended January 1, 2022. The Company operates on a 52-53 week fiscal year (4-4-5 basis) ending on the Saturday closest to December 31. Therefore, the financial results of certain fiscal years and the associated 14 week quarters will not be exactly comparable to the 52 week fiscal years and the associated quarters having only 13 weeks. As a result of using this convention, the fiscal year 2021 contained 53 weeks while each of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 contained 52 weeks.

## Basis of Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Littelfuse, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("U.S.") and include the assets, liabilities, sales and expenses of all wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control.

## Use of Estimates

The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses and the accompanying notes. The Company evaluates and updates its assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in its evaluation, as considered necessary. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

## Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

All highly liquid investments, with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased, are considered to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains several pools including multicurrency notional pools and physical pools internationally and a zero balance account ("ZBA") structure in the U.S. In the notional pools, actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. The Company will classify any overdraft balances within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 reported within the Consolidated Balance Sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

## Short-Term and Long-Term Investments

As of December 30, 2023, the Company has an investment in Polytronics Technology Corporation Ltd. ('Polytronics'). The Company's Polytronics shares held at the end of fiscal 2023 and 2022 represent approximately 6.7% of total Polytronics shares outstanding for both years. The Polytronics investment is carried at fair value. The fair value of the Polytronics investment was €9.7 million (approximately $10.8 million) at December 30, 2023 and €10.0 million (approximately $10.7 million) at December 31, 2022.

As a result of the Company's acquisition of IXYS Corporation ("IXYS"), the Company has equity ownerships in various investments that are accounted for under the equity method. The Company owns 45% of the outstanding equity of Powersem GmbH, a module manufacturer based in Germany, approximately 19% of the outstanding equity of EB Tech Ltd., a company with expertise in radiation technology based in South Korea, and approximately 24% of the outstanding common shares of Automated Technology, Inc., a supplier located in the Philippines that provides assembly and test services. The Company recognized gains of $0.5 million from its equity method investment for both the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The balance of these equity method investments was $14.0 million and $13.5 million as of the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. See Note 18, Related Party Transactions, for further discussion.

The Company has investments related to its non-qualified Supplemental Retirement and Savings Plan. The Company maintains accounts for participants through which participants make investment elections. The investment securities are subject to the claims of the Company's creditors. The investment securities are all mutual funds. The investment securities are measured at net asset value. As of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the investment securities balance was $20.1 million and $14.1 million, respectively, related to the plan and are included in Other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

## Trade Receivables

The Company performs credit evaluations of customers' financial condition and generally does not require collateral. A receivable is considered past due if payments have not been received within agreed upon invoice terms. Write-offs are recorded at the time a customer receivable is deemed uncollectible.

The Company also maintains allowances against trade receivables for the settlement of rebates and sales discounts to customers. These allowances are based upon specific customer sales and sales discounts as well as actual historical experience.

## Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which approximates current replacement cost. Cost is principally determined using the first-in, first-out method. The Company maintains excess and obsolete reserves against inventory to reduce the carrying value to the expected net realizable value. These reserves are based upon a combination of factors including historical sales volume, market conditions, lower of cost or net realizable value of the inventory.

## Property, Plant, and Equipment

Land, buildings, and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method with useful lives of up to 35 years for buildings, three to 20 years for equipment, seven years for furniture and fixtures, five years for tooling and three years for computer equipment. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful life or the lease term. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred. Major overhauls that extend the useful lives of existing assets are capitalized.

## Goodwill

The Company annually tests goodwill for impairment on the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.

## Table of Contents

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company compares each reporting unit's fair value, estimated based on comparable company market valuations and expected future discounted cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit, to its carrying value. The results of the annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2023 indicated that the estimated fair values for each of the seven reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values. As of the most recent annual test conducted on October 1, 2023, the Company noted that the excess of fair value over the carrying value, was 110%, 80%, 126%, 47%, 58%, 23%, and 369% for its reporting units; ElectronicsPassive Products and Sensors, Electronics-Semiconductor, Passenger Car Products, Commercial Vehicle Products, Automotive Sensors, Industrial Controls and Sensors, and Industrial Circuit Protection, respectively. Relatively small changes in the Company's key assumptions would not have resulted in any reporting units failing the goodwill impairment test. See Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, for additional information.

There were no impairment charges recorded during the fiscal years of 2023, 2022, and 2021.

The Company also performs an interim review for indicators of impairment each quarter to assess whether an interim impairment review is required for any reporting unit. As part of its interim reviews, management analyzes potential changes in the value of individual reporting units based on each reporting unit's operating results for the period compared to expected results as of the prior year's annual impairment test. In addition, management considers how other key assumptions, including discount rates and expected long-term growth rates, used in the last annual impairment test, could be impacted by changes in market conditions and economic events. Based on the interim assessments as of December 30, 2023, management concluded that no events or changes in circumstances indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value for any reporting unit had declined below its carrying value.

## Long-Lived Assets

Customer relationships, trademarks and tradenames are amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives that have a range of 3 to 20 years. Patents, licenses and software are amortized using the straight-line method or an accelerated method over estimated useful lives that have a range of 4 to 17 years. The distribution networks are amortized on either a straight-line or accelerated basis over estimated useful lives that have a range of 4 to 10 years. Land use rights are amortized using the straight-line method up to 50 years which is the term of the land use rights.

The Company assesses potential impairments to its long-lived assets if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair value based upon the most recent information available. Estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting estimated future cash flows. Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other intangible assets, that are held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying value or the fair market value less the estimated cost to sell.

## Environmental Liabilities

Environmental  liabilities  are  accrued  based  on  engineering  studies  estimating  the  cost  of  remediating  sites.  Expenses  related  to  on-going  maintenance  of environmental sites are expensed as incurred. If actual or estimated probable future losses exceed the Company's recorded liability for such claims, the Company would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred.

## Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits

The Company records annual income and expense amounts relating to its pension and post-retirement benefits plans based on calculations which include various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, expected long-term rates of return and compensation increases. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis as of the fiscal year-end balance sheet date (or more frequently if a significant event requiring remeasurement occurs) and modifies the assumption based on current rates and trends when it is appropriate to do so. The effects of modifications are recognized immediately on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, but are generally amortized into operating earnings over future periods, with the deferred amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience, market conditions and input from its actuaries and investment advisors.

See Note 16, Segment Information, for net sales by segment and countries.

The  Company  recognizes  revenue  on  product  sales  in  the  period  in  which  the  Company  satisfies  its  performance  obligation  and  control  of  the  product  is transferred  to  the  customer. The  Company's sales arrangements with customers are predominately short term in nature and generally provide for transfer of control at the time of shipment as this is the point at which title and risk of loss of the product transfers to the customer. At the end of each period, for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer, the Company adjusts revenues and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when they are received by the customer. The amount of revenue recorded reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for goods and may include adjustments for customer allowance, rebates and price adjustments. The Company's distribution channels are primarily through direct sales and independent third-party distributors.

The Company has elected the practical expedient under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 340-40-25-4 to expense commissions when incurred as the amortization period of the commission asset the Company would have otherwise recognized is less than one year.

## Revenue and Billing

The Company generally accepts orders from customers through receipt of purchase orders or electronic data interchange based on written sales agreements and purchasing  contracts.  Contract  pricing  and  selling  agreement  terms  are  based  on  market  factors,  costs,  and  competition.  Pricing  is  often  negotiated  as  an adjustment (premium or discount) from the Company's published price lists. The customer is invoiced when the Company's products are shipped to them in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement. As the Company's standard payment terms are less than one year, the Company has elected the practical expedient under ASC 606-10-32-18 to not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component. The Company also elected the practical expedient provided  in  ASC  606-10-25-18B  to  treat  all  product  shipping  and  handling  activities  as  fulfillment  activities,  and  therefore  recognize  the  gross  revenue associated with the contract, inclusive of any shipping and handling revenue.

## Table of Contents

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Ship and Debit Program

Some of the terms of the Company's sales agreements and normal business conditions provide customers (distributors) the ability to receive price adjustments on products previously shipped and invoiced. This practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a 'ship and debit' program. This program allows the distributor  to  debit  the  Company  for  the  difference  between  the  distributors'  contracted  price  and  a  lower  price  for  specific  transactions.  Under  certain circumstances (usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity), a distributor will request authorization for pricing allowances to reduce its price. When the Company approves such a reduction, the distributor is authorized to 'debit' its account for the difference between the contracted price and the lower approved price. The Company establishes reserves for this program based on historic activity, distributor inventory levels and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these debits as a reduction of revenue.

## Return to Stock

The  Company  has  a  return  to  stock  policy  whereby  certain  customers,  with  prior  authorization  from  the  Company's  management,  can  return  previously purchased goods for full or partial credit. The Company establishes an estimated allowance for these returns based on historic activity. Sales revenue and cost of sales are reduced to anticipate estimated returns.

## Volume Rebates

The Company offers volume-based sales incentives to certain customers to encourage greater product sales. If customers achieve their specific quarterly or annual sales targets, they are entitled to rebates. The Company estimates the projected amount of rebates that will be achieved by the customer and recognizes this estimated cost as a reduction to revenue as products are sold.

## Allowance for Credit Losses

The Company currently measures the expected credit losses based on our historical credit loss experience. The Company has not experienced significant recent or  historical  credit  losses  and  is  not  forecasting  any  significant  credit  losses  which  would  require  adjustments  to  our  methodology.  If  current  conditions  and supportable forecasts indicate that our historical loss experience is not reasonable and no longer supportable, the Company may adjust its historical credit loss experience and to reflect these conditions and forecasts. The Company regularly analyzes its significant customer accounts and, when the Company becomes aware of a customer's inability to meet its financial obligations, the Company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes is collectible. The Company also analyzes all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, macroeconomic considerations and historical collection and loss experience. Historically, the allowance for credit losses has been adequate to cover bad debts. If circumstances related to specific customers change, the estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.

As of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company's allowance for credit losses was $2.2 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Additionally, the Company had $5.4 million and $4.8 million of trade receivables greater than 90 days past due as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

## Advertising Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred, which amounted to $4.0 million, $3.8 million, and $2.1 million in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are included as a component of selling, general, and administrative expenses.

## Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs

Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue. Costs incurred for shipping and handling of $15.4 million, $13.9 million, and $15.4 million in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, are classified in selling, general, and administrative expenses.

## Table of Contents

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Foreign Currency Translation / Remeasurement

The Company's foreign subsidiaries use the local currency or the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, as appropriate. Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates  at  the  balance  sheet  date,  and  revenues  and  expenses  are  translated  at  weighted  average  rates. Adjustments  from  the  translation  process  are recognized in Shareholders' equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The amount of foreign currency gain or loss recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Net Income were losses of $12.3 million, $24.4 million, and $17.2 million in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

## Stock-Based Compensation

The Company recognizes compensation expense for the cost of awards of equity compensation using a fair value method. Benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense are reported as operating cash flows. See Note 12, Stock-Based Compensation ,  for  additional  information  on  stock-based compensation.

## Coal Mining Liability

Included in accrued liabilities is an accrual related to former coal mining operations at Littelfuse GmbH (formerly known as Heinrich Industries, AG) for the amounts of €2.5 million ($2.7 million) and €1.6 million ($1.7 million) at December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Management, in conjunction with an independent third-party, performs an annual evaluation of the former coal mining operations in order to develop an estimate of the probable future obligations in regard to remediating the dangers (such as a shaft collapse) of abandoned coal mine shafts in the former coal mining operations. Management accrues  for  costs  associated  with  such  remediation  efforts  based  on  management's  best  estimate  when  such  costs  are  probable  and  reasonably  able  to  be estimated. The ultimate determination can only be done after respective investigations because the concrete conditions are mostly unknown at this time.

## Other (Income) Expense, Net

Other (income) expense, net generally consists of interest income, royalties, change in fair value of available-for-sale securities, pension non-service costs and settlements and other non-operating (income) expense.

## Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred taxes are recognized for the future effects of temporary differences between  financial  and  income  tax  reporting  using  enacted  tax  rates  in  effect  for  the  years  in  which  the  differences  are  expected  to  reverse.  The  Company recognizes deferred taxes for temporary differences, operating loss carryforwards, and tax credit and other tax attribute carryforwards (excluding carryforwards where usage has been determined to be remote). Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. U.S. state and non-U.S. income taxes are provided on the portion of non-U.S. income that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable (and non-U.S. income taxes are provided on the portion of non-U.S. income that is expected to be remitted to an upper-tier non-U.S. entity). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

Deferred U.S. income taxes and non-U.S. taxes are not provided on the excess of the investment value for financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in those non-U.S. subsidiaries for which such excess is considered to be permanently reinvested in those operations. Management regularly evaluates whether nonU.S. earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested. This evaluation requires judgment about the future operating and liquidity needs of the Company and its non-U.S. subsidiaries. Changes in economic and business conditions, tax laws, or the Company's financial situation could result in changes to these judgments and the need to record additional tax liabilities.

The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), among other things, imposed a one-time tax (the 'Toll Charge') on accumulated earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries and included base broadening provisions commonly referred to as the global intangible low-taxed income provisions ("GILTI").

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company elected to pay the 2017 Littelfuse Toll Charge over the eight-year period prescribed by the Tax Act. The long-term portion of this Toll Charge which remains payable as of December 30, 2023, totaling $8.2 million, is recorded in Other long-term liabilities ,  and the anticipated 2024 annual installment payment of $6.6 million is included in Accrued income taxes , on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 30, 2023.

In accordance with guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") staff, the Company has adopted an accounting policy to treat any GILTI inclusions as a period cost if and when incurred. Thus, for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, deferred taxes were computed without consideration of the possible future impact of the GILTI provisions, and any current year impact was recorded as a part of the current portion of income tax expense.

## Fair Value Measurements

Certain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The Company records the fair value of its available-for-sale securities and pension plan assets on a recurring basis. Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include long-lived assets held and used, long-lived assets held for sale, goodwill and other intangible assets. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying values. The three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes valuation methodologies based on the reliability of the inputs, is:

- Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
- Level 2 - Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.

Level 3 - Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting the Company's own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants.

## Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In  December  2023,  the  FASB  issued  Accounting  Standards  Updates  ("ASU")  No.  2023-09,  "Income  Taxes  (Topic  740):  Improvements  to  Income  Tax Disclosures". The  amendments  in  this  update  provide  more  transparency  about  income  tax  information  through  improvements  to  the  income  tax  disclosure primarily  related  to  the  income  tax  rate  reconciliation  and  income  taxes  paid  information. These  requirements  include:  (1)  consistent  categories  and  greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The other amendments in this update improve the effectiveness  and  comparability  of  disclosures  by  (3)  adding  disclosures  of  pretax  income  (or  loss)  and  income  tax  expense  (or  benefit),  and  (4)  removing disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial or relevant. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance will modify our disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, "Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures". The amendments in  this  update  require  additional  detailed  and  enhanced  information  about  reportable  segments'  expense,  including  significant  segment  expenses  and  other segment items that bridge segment revenue, significant expenses to segment profit or loss. The ASU also requires disclosure of the title and position of the Chief Operating  Decision  Maker  ('CODM')  on  annual  basis  as  well  as  an  explanation  of  how  CODM  uses  the  reported  measures  and  other  disclosures.  The amendments in this update do not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance will modify our disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-06, "Disclosure Improvements". The amendments in this update represent changes to clarify or improve the disclosure or presentation requirements of a variety of Topics in the ASC. The Company may be affected by one or more of those amendments. The amendments in this ASU should be applied prospectively and will not be effective until June 30, 2027. The company is currently evaluating the potential effects of these amendments on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01, "Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements". The standard requires that leasehold improvements associated  with  common  control  leases  be:  1)  Amortized  by  the  lessee  over  the  useful  life  of  the  leasehold  improvements  to  the  common  control  group (regardless of the lease term) as long as the lessee controls the use of the underlying asset (the leased asset) through a lease. However, if the lessor obtained the right to control the use of the underlying asset through a lease with another entity not within the same common control group, the amortization period may not exceed the amortization period of the common control group. 2) Accounted for as a transfer between entities under common control through an adjustment to equity  (or  net  assets  for  not-for-profit  entities)  if,  and  when,  the  lessee  no  longer  controls  the  use  of  the  underlying  asset.  Additionally,  those  leasehold improvements are subject to the impairment guidance in Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,  2023  including  interim  periods  within  those  fiscal  years.  The  Company  does  not  expect  any  material  effect  on  the  Company's  Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company tests its goodwill annually for impairment on the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. There were no impairment charges recorded during the fiscal years of 2023, 2022 and 2021.

## 7. Lease Commitments

Under ASC 842, a contract contains a lease if there is an identified asset and the Company has the right to control the asset. The Company determines whether a contract contains a lease at contract inception. The Company leases office and production space under various non-cancellable operating leases that expire no later  than  2035.  Certain  real  estate  leases  include  one  or  more  options  to  renew.  The  exercise  of  lease  renewal  options  is  at  the  Company's  sole  discretion. Options to extend the lease are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the option. The Company also has production equipment, office equipment and vehicles under operating leases and finance leases that were acquired through the C&amp;K acquisition.The depreciable life of assets  and  leasehold  improvements are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option that is reasonably certain of exercise. Certain leases include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. The lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantee or material restrictive covenants. The Company has elected to use the available practical expedient to account for the lease and non-lease components of its leases as a single component. As the Company elected not to separate lease and non-lease components and instead to account for them as a single lease component, the variable lease cost primarily represents variable payments such as common area maintenance and utilities.

The Company does not have a published credit rating because it has no publicly traded debt; therefore, the Company is generating its incremental borrowing rate ("IBR"),  using  a  synthetic  credit  rating  model  that  compares  its  credit  quality  to  other  rated  companies  based  on  certain  financial  metrics  and  ratios.  The reference rate will be based on the yield curve of companies with similar credit quality based on the metrics and adjusted for currency in regions where we have significant operations.

All leases with an initial term of 12 months or less that do not include an option to extend or purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise ('short-term leases') are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Short-term lease expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The following table presents the classification of right of use assets and lease liabilities as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:

Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company may, from time to time, increase the size of the revolving credit facility or enter into one or more tranches of term loans in minimum increments of $25 million if there is no event of default and the Company is in compliance with certain financial covenants.

Loans made under the available credit facility pursuant to the Credit Agreement ("the Credit Facility") bear interest at the Company's option, at either SOFR, fixed for interest periods of one, two, three or six-month periods, plus 1.00% to 1.75%, plus a SOFR adjustment of 0.10% or at the bank's Base Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus 0.00% to 0.75%, based upon the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Company is also required to pay commitment fees on unused portions of the Credit Facility ranging from 0.10% to 0.175%, based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement includes representations, covenants and events of default that are customary for financing transactions of this nature.

## 10. Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities

For  assets  and  liabilities  measured  at  fair  value  on  a  recurring  and  nonrecurring  basis,  a  three-level  hierarchy  of  measurements  based  upon  observable  and unobservable inputs is used to arrive at fair value. Observable inputs are developed based on market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company's assumptions about valuation based on the best information available in the circumstances. Depending on the inputs, the Company classifies each fair value measurement as follows:

- Level 1 -Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;
- Level 2 -Valuations based upon quoted prices for similar instruments, prices for identical  or  similar  instruments  in  markets  that  are  not  active,  or model-derived valuations, all of whose significant inputs are observable, and
- Level 3 -Valuations based upon one or more significant unobservable inputs.

There were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the year ended December 30, 2023.

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value and their classification in the valuation hierarchy.

## Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents primarily consist of money market funds, certificates of deposit, and short-term time deposits, which are held with institutions with sound credit ratings and are highly liquid. The Company classified cash equivalents as Level 1 and are valued at cost, which approximates fair value.

## Investments in Equity Securities

Investments in equity securities listed on a national market or exchange are valued at the last sales price and classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Such securities are further detailed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Information .

## Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments

On May 12, 2022, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage interest rate risk exposure, effectively converting the interest rate on the Company's SOFR based floating-rate loans to a fixed-rate. The interest rate swap, with a notional value of $200 million, was designated as a cash flow hedge against the variability of cash flows associated with the Company's SOFR based loans scheduled to mature on June 30, 2027. The fair value of the interest rate swap was valued using an independent third-party valuation model. Pursuant to this model, changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income until the underlying transactions are recognized in earnings. The primary inputs into the valuation of the interest rate swap are interest yield curves, interest rate volatility, credit risk, credit spreads and other market information. The interest rate swap is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, since all significant inputs are corroborated by observable market data.

The use of derivatives creates exposure to credit risk relating to potential losses that could be recognized in the event that the counterparties to these instruments fail to perform their obligations under the contracts. The Company seeks to minimize this risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings and monitoring the total value of positions with individual counterparties. In the event of a default by one of our counterparties, the Company may not receive payments provided for under the terms of our derivatives.

## Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments

On July 14, 2022, the Company entered into a foreign currency exchange forward contract to mitigate the currency fluctuation risk between the Euro and U.S. dollar on its Euro denominated Senior Notes, Series A due 2023. The notional value of the forward contract at July 14, 2022 was €117 million and expired on December 7, 2023 with the final settlement value of $6.3 million which the Company used to convert USD to Euro to pay down the €117 million of Euro Senior Notes, Series A due 2023. The foreign currency contract was not designated as a hedge instrument and was marked to market on a monthly basis. As a result, changes in fair value during 2023 and 2022 are reported in Foreign exchange loss in the Consolidated Statements of Net Income. The fair value of the foreign currency forward contract was valued by a third party using market exchange rates and classified as a Level 2 input under the fair value hierarchy.

In addition to the methods and assumptions used for the financial instruments recorded at fair value as discussed above, the following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of other financial instruments that are not marked to market on a recurring basis. The Company's other financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade receivables and its long-term debt. Due to their short-term maturity, the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and trade receivables approximate their fair values. The Company's revolving and term loan debt facilities' fair values approximate book value at December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, as the rates on these borrowings are variable in nature.

Additionally, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.7 million for certain machinery and equipment within Electronics segment due to a decision to cease further production of a product line during the fourth quarter of 2022. The fair value of the patent, technology and machinery and equipment were measured on a nonrecurring basis using Level 3 inputs under the  fair  value  hierarchy.  The  Company's  accounting  and  finance  management  determines  the  valuation  policies  and  procedures  for  Level  3  fair  value measurements and is responsible for the development and determination of unobservable inputs.

## 11. Benefit Plans

The  Company  has  Company-sponsored  and  mandatory  defined  benefit  pension  plans  covering  employees  in  the  United  Kingdom  ("U.K."),  Germany,  the Philippines, China, Japan, Mexico, Italy and France. The amount of the retirement benefits provided under the plans is generally based on years of service and final average pay.

On April 7, 2020, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to purchase a group annuity contract, under which an insurance company is required to directly  pay  and  administer  pension  payments  to  certain  of  the  Company's  U.K.  pension  plan  participants,  or  their  designated  beneficiaries.  The  Company completed the buy-out of this U.K. pension plan during the fourth quarter of 2021 and as a result recorded a non-cash pension settlement charge of $19.9 million (£14.9 million), inclusive of the accelerated recognition of prior service cost of $0.5 million (£0.4 million).

## Defined Benefit Plan Assets

Based upon analysis of the target asset allocation and historical returns by type of investment, the Company has assumed that the expected long-term rate of return will be 5.2% on plan assets. Assets are invested to maximize long-term return taking into consideration timing of settlement of the retirement liabilities and liquidity needs for benefits payments. Pension plan assets were invested as follows, and were not materially different from the target asset allocation:

|                                      | Asset Allocation   | Asset Allocation   |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
|                                      | 2023               | 2022               |
| Cash and cash equivalents, and other | 3 %                | 13 %               |
| Equity securities                    | 7 %                | 14 %               |
| Fixed income securities              | 90 %               | 73 %               |

The Company segregated its plan assets by the following major categories and level for determining their fair value as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. All plan assets that are valued using the net asset value per share ('NAV') practical expedient have not been included within the fair value hierarchy but are separately disclosed.

Cash and cash equivalents Carrying value approximates fair value. As such, these assets were classified as Level 1. The Company also invests in certain shortterm investments which are valued using the amortized cost method. Lastly, the Company has certain pooled pension funds that have short-term investments with third party mutual funds that are valued at unit value per share at measurement date. As such, these assets were classified as Level 2.

Equity The values of individual equity securities were based on quoted prices in active markets. As such, these assets are classified as Level 1. The Company has  certain  pooled  pension  funds  which  have  mutual  funds  with  underlying  investments  in  certain  equity  securities  that  are  not  quoted  on  active  markets; therefore, they were classified as Level 2.

Fixed income -  Fixed  income securities are typically priced based on a last trade basis and are exchange-traded. Accordingly, the Company classified fixed income securities as Level 1. The Company has certain pooled pension funds which have mutual funds with underlying investments in fixed income securities and funds priced based on a valuation model rather than a last trade basis and are not exchange-traded. As such, they were classified as Level 2. The Company also invests in certain fixed income funds which are valued at NAV.

Insurance Contracts and other - This category includes pooled pension funds which have mutual funds with underlying investments in other assets and liabilities including alternatives priced based on a valuation model and are not exchange-traded. These were classified as Level 2. This category includes also insurance contracts that are valued by the re-insurer with the valuation inputs being not highly observable or traded on an open market. Accordingly, insurance contracts were categorized as Level 3. Lastly, this category includes other assets and liabilities including futures or swaps.

For any Level 2 and Level 3 plan assets, management reviews significant investments on a periodic basis including investigation of unusual fluctuations in price or returns and obtaining an understanding of the pricing methodology to assess the reliability of third-party pricing estimates.

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The valuation methodologies described above may generate a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or future fair values. While the Company believes the valuation methodologies used are appropriate, the use of different methodologies or assumptions in calculating fair value could result in different amounts. The Company invests in assets in which valuation is determined by NAV. The Company believes that the NAV is representative of fair value at the reporting date, as there are no significant restrictions on redemption of these investments or other reasons to indicate that the investment would be redeemed at an amount different than the NAV.

The following table presents the Company's pension plan assets measured at fair value by classification within the fair value hierarchy as of December 30, 2023:

vested in their contributions plus actual earnings thereon, as well as the Company contributions. Company matching contributions amounted to $7.7 million, $5.5 million, and $5.0 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

## Non-qualified Supplemental Retirement and Savings Plan

The Company has a non-qualified Supplemental Retirement and Savings Plan which provides additional retirement benefits for certain management employees and named executive officers by allowing participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation. The Company maintains accounts for participants through which participants make investment elections. The investments are subject to the claims of the Company's creditors and the Company is responsible for the payment of all benefits under the plan from its general assets. As of December 30, 2023, there was $20.1 million of marketable securities related to the plan included in Other assets and $20.1 million of accrued compensation benefits included in Other long-term liabilities . The marketable securities are classified as Level 1 under the fair value hierarchy as they are maintained in mutual funds with readily determinable fair value. The Company made matching contributions to the plan of $0.6 million, $0.2 million, and $0.2 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

## 12. Stock-Based Compensation

Equity Plans : The Company has equity-based compensation plans authorizing the granting of stock options, restricted shares, restricted share units, and other stock rights to employees and directors. During the fiscal year 2023, the Company designated an additional 0.7 million shares for the Company's equity-based compensation  plans.  As  of  December  30,  2023,  there  were  1.2  million  shares  available  for  issuance  of  future  awards  under  the  Company's  equity-based compensation plans.

Stock options generally vest over a three-year period and are exercisable over either a seven or ten-year period commencing from the date of the grant. Restricted shares  and  share  units  granted  by  the  Company  generally  vest  over  three  years.  Stock  options  and  restricted  share  units  may  have  accelerated  vesting  upon meeting certain qualified conditions.

The following table provides a reconciliation of outstanding stock options for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $12.2 million, $3.7 million, and $23.8 million, respectively. The total fair value of the vested RSU shares was $19.8 million, $15.4 million, and $18.9 million for 2023, 2022,

and 2021, respectively. The total amount of share-based liabilities paid was $2.2 million, $1.1 million and $1.3 million for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

The  Company  recognizes  compensation  cost  of  all  share-based  awards  as  an  expense  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  vesting  period  of  the  awards.  At December 30, 2023, the unrecognized compensation cost for options and restricted shares was $22.1 million before tax, and will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years. Compensation cost included as a component of cost of sales, research and development and selling, general, and administrative expenses for all equity compensation plans discussed above was $25.7 million, $24.6 million, and $21.4 million for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The total related income tax benefit recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Net Income was $3.8 million, $3.5 million and $3.3 million for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of stock option awards granted. The weighted average fair value of and related assumptions for options granted are as follows:

|                                                | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |
|------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Weighted average fair value of options granted | $77.40 | $70.39 | $74.04 |
| Assumptions:                                   |        |        |        |
| Risk-free interest rate                        | 3.67%  | 2.83%  | 0.66%  |
| Expected dividend yield                        | 1.00%  | 0.92%  | 0.72%  |
| Expected stock price volatility                | 36.0%  | 35.0%  | 35.0%  |
| Expected life of options (years)               | 4.4    | 4.4    | 4.4    |

Expected volatilities  are  based  on  the  historical  volatility  of  the  Company's  stock  price. The  expected  life  of  options  is  based  on  historical  data  for  options granted by the Company. The risk-free rates are based on yields available at the time of grant on U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities consistent with the expected life assumption. Historical nonvested forfeiture information is the basis for the forfeiture rate assumptions.

The fair value of RSU is determined based on the Company's stock price on the grant date reduced by the present value of expected dividends through the vesting period.

Preferred  Stock :  The  Board  of  Directors  may  authorize  the  issuance  of  preferred  stock  from  time  to  time  in  one  or  more  series  with  such  designations, preferences, qualifications, limitations, restrictions, and optional or other special rights as the Board may fix by resolution.

## Share Repurchase Program

On April 28, 2021, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a three-year program to repurchase up to $300 million in the aggregate of shares of the Company's common stock for the period May 1, 2021 to April 30, 2024. There are $300 million in the aggregate of shares available for purchase under the program as of December 30, 2023.

During the fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock.

## 14. Income Taxes

The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), among other things, imposed a one-time tax (the 'Toll Charge') on accumulated earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries and included base broadening provisions commonly referred to as the global intangible low-taxed income provisions ("GILTI").

The Company elected to pay the 2017 Littelfuse Toll Charge over the eight-year period prescribed by the Tax Act. The long-term portion of this Toll Charge which remains payable as of December 30, 2023, totaling $8.2 million, is recorded in Other long-term liabilities ,  and the anticipated 2024 annual installment payment of $6.6 million is included in Accrued income taxes , on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 30, 2023.

In accordance with guidance issued by the FASB staff, the Company has adopted an accounting policy to treat any GILTI inclusions as a period cost if and when incurred. Thus, for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022, and January 1, 2022, deferred taxes were computed without consideration of the possible future impact of the GILTI provisions, and any current year impact was recorded as a part of the current portion of income tax expense.

Domestic and foreign income (loss) before income taxes is as follows:

| (in thousands)             | 2023      | 2022      | 2021      |

The deferred tax asset valuation allowance is mainly related to certain U.S. and non-U.S. net operating loss and non-U.S. interest expense carryforwards which are not more likely that not to be realized. The remaining U.S. and non-U.S. net operating loss and interest expense carryforwards either have no expiration date or are expected to be utilized prior to expiration (which begin expiring in 2025). No deferred tax asset nor valuation allowance has been recorded for certain U.S. and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards for which the possibility of usage has been determined to be remote.

The Company paid income taxes of $81.1 million, $96.8 million, and $58.2 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, and received income tax refunds of $7.2 million, $3.2 million, and $2.6 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

Deferred income taxes are not provided on the excess of the investment value for financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in those subsidiaries for which such excess is considered to be permanently reinvested in those operations. The Company believes the determination of the amount of such deferred income taxes is impractical as it  would  depend  upon  income  tax  laws  and  circumstances  at  the  time  of  the  hypothetical  distributions  or  dispositions. As  of December 30, 2023, unremitted earnings of the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries were approximately $1.5 billion. A distribution of such earnings will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. The Company recognized deferred tax liabilities of $18.6 million as of December 30, 2023 and $16.3 million as of December 31, 2022, related to taxes on certain non-U.S. earnings which are not considered to be permanently reinvested.

The Company has two subsidiaries in China which benefit from lower tax rates due to 'tax holidays' which apply for three-year periods. The tax holiday for one of the subsidiaries expired at the end of 2022, but was later extended for an additional three years, retroactive to include all of 2023, as well as 2024 and 2025, and for the other subsidiary the tax holiday expired at the end of 2023. The Company intends to seek an extension for the expired tax holiday. Together, the tax holidays contributed $5.8 million in tax benefits, or $0.23 per diluted share, during 2023. Future year tax benefits will depend upon the Company's ability to obtain extensions, after the three-year periods expire. There can be no assurance that future extensions will be granted.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 30, 2023, December 31, 2022, and January 1, 2022 is as follows:

The December 30, 2023 total in the table above represents the net amount of tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate in future periods. Of this amount, approximately $7.8 million may be recognized in 2024 based upon the possible lapse in the statute of limitations. None of the positions included in unrecognized tax benefits are related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense. The Company recognized such interest expense of $0.5 million (net of a $1.7 million decrease due to a lapse in the statute of limitations), $1.4 million (net of a $0.2 million decrease due to a lapse  in  the  statute  of  limitations)  and  $1.6  million  (net  of  a  $0.6  million  decrease  due  to  a  lapse  in  the  statute  of  limitations)  in  2023,  2022,  and  2021, respectively. Accrued  interest  for  such  matters  included  in Other  long-term  liabilities within  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  was  $14.4  million  and  $11.8 million as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

The U.S. federal statute of limitations remains open for the Company for the 2017 tax year (with respect to the Toll Charge) and later years. Non-U.S. and U.S. state statutes of limitations generally range from three to seven years, although certain jurisdictions do not have a statute expiration. Tax examinations occur from time to time, including examinations currently in process in Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore, and certain U.S. states. The Company does not expect to recognize a significant amount of additional tax expense as a result of concluding these examinations.

## 16. Segment Information

The  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  design,  manufacture  and  sell  component,  modules  and  subassemblies  to  empower  the  long-term  structural  themes  of sustainability, connectivity and safety. The Company reports its operations by the following segments: Electronics, Transportation, and Industrial. An operating segment is defined as a component of an enterprise that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, and about which separate financial information is regularly evaluated by the Chief Operating Decision Maker ('CODM') in deciding how to allocate resources. The CODM is the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer ('CEO'). The CODM allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about its revenue and operating income (loss) before interest and taxes, but does not evaluate the operating segments using discrete balance sheet information.

Sales, marketing, and research and development expenses are charged directly into each operating segment. Purchasing, logistics, customer service, finance, information technology, and human resources are shared functions that are allocated back to the three operating segments. The Company does not report intersegment revenue because the operating segments do not record it.  Certain expenses, determined by the CODM to be strategic in nature and not directly related to segments current results, are not allocated but identified as 'Other'. Additionally, the Company does not allocate interest and other income, interest expense, or taxes to operating segments. These costs are not allocated to the segments, as management excludes such costs when assessing the performance of the segments. Although the CODM uses operating income (loss) to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. Except as discussed above, the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for the Company as a whole.

- · Electronics  Segment :  Consists  of  one  of  the  broadest  product  offerings  in  the  industry,  including  fuses  and  fuse  accessories,  positive  temperature coefficient  ('PTC')  resettable  fuses,  electromechanical  switches  and  interconnect  solutions,  polymer  electrostatic  discharge  ('ESD')  suppressors, varistors,  reed  switch  based  magnetic  sensing,  gas  discharge  tubes;  semiconductor  products  such  as  discrete  transient  voltage  suppressor  ('TVS') diodes,  TVS  diode  arrays,  protection  and  switching  thyristors,  silicon  and  silicon  carbide  metal-oxide-semiconductor  field  effect  transistors ('MOSFETs') and diodes; and insulated gate bipolar transistors ('IGBT') technologies. The segment covers a broad range of end markets, including industrial motor drives and power conversion, automotive electronics, electric vehicle and related charging infrastructure, aerospace, power supplies, data centers and telecommunications, medical devices, alternative energy and energy storage, building and home automation, appliances, and mobile electronics.

## 17. Commitments and Contingencies

## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 30, 2023, the Company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules. Specifically, the Company was not liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties, the Company was not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity and the Company did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets. The Company does not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities.

## Product Warranty Liabilities

Our policy is to accrue for warranty claims when a loss is both probable and estimable. Liabilities for warranty claims have historically not been material and in limited instances, customer may make claims for costs they incurred or other damages related to a claim.

## Environmental Remediation Liabilities

Refer to Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Information related to environmental liabilities. Our operations and facilities are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and our employees, including those governing air emissions, chemical usage, water discharges, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, civil or criminal sanctions, or third-party property damage or personal injury claims, in the event of violations or liabilities under  these  laws  and  regulations,  or  non-compliance  with  the  environmental  permits  required  at  our  facilities.  Potentially  significant  expenditures  could  be required in order to comply with environmental laws that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We are, however, not aware of any threatened or pending material environmental investigations, lawsuits, or claims involving the Company or its operations.

## Legal Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, the Company may be involved in a number of claims and litigation matters. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these matters, based upon our experience and current information known to us, we do not expect the outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and/or cash flows.

The  Company  accounts  for  litigation  and  claims  losses  in  accordance  with  FASB  ASC  Topic  450, Contingencies where  loss  contingency  provisions  are recognized for probable and estimable losses at our best estimate of a loss or, when a best estimate cannot be made, at our estimate of the minimum loss. These estimates  require  the  application  of  considerable  judgment  and  are  refined  each  accounting  period  as  additional  information  becomes  known.  We  are  often initially  unable  to  develop  a  best  estimate  of  loss  and  therefore  the  minimum  amount,  which  could  be  an  immaterial  amount,  is  recognized. As  information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, or a best estimate can be made, resulting in additional loss provisions. A best estimate may be changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected.

## Pending Litigation and Claims

There are no material pending litigation or claims outstanding as of December 30, 2023.

## ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate,  to  allow  for  timely  decisions  regarding  required  disclosure.  In  designing  and  evaluating  the  disclosure  controls  and  procedures,  the  Company recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and the Company is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

As required by SEC Rule 15d-15(b), the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to SEC Rule 13a-15 as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 30, 2023.

## Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management to include in this Annual Report on Form 10-K a report on management's assessment of the effectiveness  of  the  Company's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  as  well  as  an  attestation  report  from  the  Company's  independent  registered  public accounting firm on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The Company's internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to its management and the Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

## Table of Contents

All  internal  control  systems,  no  matter  how  well  designed,  have  inherent  limitations.  Therefore,  even  those  systems  determined  effective  can  provide  only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in the internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statement will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

The Company's management, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023, based upon the updated framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, the Company's management concluded that, as of December 30, 2023, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective.

## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the 12 months or fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

The  IXYS  Corporation  2009  Equity  Incentive  Plan expired in June 2019 and equity awards remain outstanding under it.

(1) The weighted average exercise price does not take into account the shares issuable upon the vesting of outstanding restricted stock units, which have no exercise price.

(2) Includes 132,662 shares reserved for issuance upon vesting of outstanding restricted stock units and 555,776 outstanding stock options granted under the Littelfuse, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan.

(3) Includes 39,623 shares reserved for issuance upon vesting of outstanding restricted stock units under the IXYS Plans and 42,581 outstanding stock options granted under the IXYS Plans and Zilog Plan. Below is a brief description of the material features of the compensation plans acquired pursuant to the acquisition of IXYS.

## IXYS Plans

In  connection with the acquisition of IXYS, we assumed the IXYS Corporation 2009 Equity Incentive Plan, IXYS Corporation 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, IXYS Corporation 2013 Equity Incentive Plan, IXYS Corporation 2016 Equity Incentive Plan and outstanding unvested stock options originally granted by IXYS Corporation under the IXYS Plans that were held by continuing  employees. At  the  time  of  the  acquisition  of  IXYS  Corporation,  these  awards  were converted to Littelfuse stock options, with adjustments made to the exercise price of the stock options and the number of shares subject to stock options as agreed upon in the Acquisition Agreement. These unvested options vest in accordance with their original terms, generally vesting in equal annual installments over a four-year period from the original grant date. The options, once granted, generally expire ten years from the date of grant. Under the IXYS Plans, we may grant to former employees of IXYS Corporation or its subsidiaries restricted stock awards, RSUs, stock options and stock appreciation rights with an exercise price that is no less than the fair market value on the date of grant. Equity awards granted under the IXYS Plans following the acquisition have been on similar terms and consistent  with  grants  made  pursuant  to  the  Littelfuse,  Inc  Long-Term  Incentive  Plan. The  IXYS  Corporation  2009,  2011,  2013  Equity  Incentive  Plans expired in June 2019, June 2021 and June 2023, respectively, with no additional grants made after the expiration date. As of December 30, 2023, 136,150 shares remained available for issuance under the IXYS Plans.

## Zilog Plans

In connection with the acquisition of IXYS Corporation, we assumed the Zilog, Inc. 2004 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan and outstanding stock options originally granted by IXYS Corporation under the Zilog Plan that were held by continuing employees of Zilog. At the time of the acquisition of IXYS Corporation, these awards were converted to Littelfuse stock options, with adjustments made to the exercise price of the stock options and the number of shares subject to stock options as agreed upon in the Acquisition Agreement. These options vested in accordance with their original terms, generally in equal annual installments over a four-year period from the original grant date. The options generally expire ten years from the date of grant. The Zilog 2004 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan expired in February 2014 and no additional grants have been made thereunder. Therefore,

## Table of Contents

as of December 30, 2023, no shares remain available for issuance of new awards under the Zilog Plan and 3,457 stock options remain outstanding.

## Summary of Non-Employee Director Compensation

For  the  2023  fiscal  year,  non-employee  directors  received  an  annual  retainer  of  $85,000,  paid  in  quarterly  installments,  plus  reimbursement  of reasonable  expenses  relating  to  attendance  at  meetings.  Our  directors  are  also  reimbursed  for  the  costs  associated  with  attending  one  continuing  education program every three years. No fees are paid to directors who are employee directors. Additional annual retainers are paid to our Board leadership, as shown below:

| Board Leadership Role                           | Annual Retainer   |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Lead Director                                   | $20,000           |
| Board Chairman                                  | $75,000           |
| Audit Committee Chairperson                     | $20,000           |
| Compensation Committee Chairperson              | $15,000           |
| Nominating and Governance Committee Chairperson | $12,000           |
| Technology Committee Chairperson                | $10,000           |

In addition to cash compensation, each non-employee director received an annual equity grant under the Amended and Restated Littelfuse, Inc. LongTerm Incentive Plan (the "Long-Term Plan") valued at approximately $165,000. The equity grant is comprised of (1) one-third stock options that vest equally on the first three annual anniversaries of the grant date, have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, and expire seven years from the grant date, and (2) two-thirds restricted stock units that are granted upon the non-employee director's election or reelection to the Board at the Company's annual meeting and that vest equally on the first three annual anniversaries of the grant date.

## Insider Trading Policy

## PURPOSE

This Insider Trading Policy (the 'Policy') provides guidelines with respect to transactions in the securities of Littelfuse, Inc. (the 'Company') and the handling of confidential information about the Company and the companies with which Littelfuse does business.

## SCOPE

This Policy applies to all directors, officers and associates of the Company and its subsidiaries, and to any of their Family Members and Controlled Entities covered by this policy (each of the foregoing, a 'Covered Person,' and collectively, 'Covered Persons'). The Company may also determine that other persons should be subject to this Policy, such as contractors or consultants who have access to material non-public information.

This  Policy  applies  to  transactions  in  the  Company's  securities  (collectively  referred  to  in  this  Policy  as  'Littelfuse  Securities'),  including  the  Company's common stock, options to purchase common stock, or any other type of securities that the Company may issue.

## RESPONSIBILITY

Covered Persons have ethical and legal obligations to maintain the confidentiality of information about the Company or its subsidiaries (the Company and its subsidiaries, each a 'Littelfuse Company') and to not engage in transactions in Littelfuse Securities while in possession of material non-public information. Each individual is responsible for making sure that he or she complies with this Policy, and that any Family Member, household member or entity whose transactions are subject to this policy also complies with this Policy.

The Legal Department is responsible for implementation and administration of this Policy.

## POLICY

The Company's Board of Directors has adopted this Policy to ensure that all officers, directors and associates of the Company and its subsidiaries comply with all applicable laws and regulations concerning securities trading, commonly known as 'insider trading.' Insider trading and stock tipping, as discussed below, are criminal offenses subject to severe criminal and civil consequences as well as possible discipline or dismissal under this Policy.

## PROCEDURE

It is the policy of the Company that no director, officer or other associate of a Littelfuse Company who is aware of material non-public information relating to a Littelfuse Company directly or indirectly through Family Members or other persons or entities:

- 1. Buy, sell or engage in other transactions in Littelfuse Securities, except as otherwise specified in this Policy under the headings 'Transactions Under Company Plans,' and 'Rule 10b5-1 Plans'. This includes any transactions in Littelfuse common stock as well as transactions in any other Littelfuse Securities.
- 2. Buy or sell securities of other companies while aware of material non-public information about those companies that is obtained as a result of business dealings between a Littelfuse Company and such other companies.
- 3. Disclose  material  non-public  information to  any  unauthorized  persons  outside  Littelfuse;  commonly  known  as  'tipping.'  Covered  Persons  are prohibited from 'tipping' other persons about material non-public information or otherwise making unauthorized disclosures or use of such information, regardless of whether the person profits or intends to profit by such tipping, disclosure, or use. You must take steps to

## EXHIBIT 19.1

prevent the inadvertent disclosure of material non-public information to unauthorized persons outside Littelfuse. If you believe that the disclosure of material non-public information is necessary or appropriate for business reasons, you may consult with the Legal Department whether it concurs that such disclosure is necessary, and whether any such disclosure will comply with all applicable laws. In no event may you disclose any material nonpublic information unless the Legal Department has approved.

- 4. Assist anyone engaged in the above activities.

## Definition of Material Non-public Information

Non-public information is sometimes referred to as confidential information and means information about Littelfuse that is not known to the public-at-large. All information is considered non-public until the third trading day after it has been widely released through a press release, news wire or a report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Information is considered material if a reasonable investor would consider it important in deciding whether to trade. For example, if you are motivated to buy or sell a stock because of information you possess, the information will be considered material. Material information may be positive or negative.

## Examples of material information include:

- · change in expected revenue or earnings from what the company has publicly communicated;
- · proposed major acquisition, joint venture or disposition;
- · planned offering of securities;
- · declaration of a stock split or dividend;
- · significant new product introduction;
- · gain or loss of a major customer; or
- · significant cybersecurity incident.

## Transactions by Family Members and Others

This  Policy  applies  to  family  members  who  reside  with  you  (including  a  spouse,  a  child,  a  child  away  at  college,  stepchildren,  grandchildren,  parents, stepparents, grandparents, siblings and in-laws), anyone else who lives in your household, and any family members who do not live in your household but whose transactions in Littelfuse Securities are directed by you or are subject to your influence or control, such as parents or children who consult with you before they trade in Littelfuse Securities (collectively referred to as 'Family Members').

You  are  responsible  for  the  transactions  of  Family  Members  and  should  make  them  aware  of  the  need  to  confer  with  you  before  they  trade  in  Littelfuse Securities, and you should treat all such transactions for the purpose of this Policy and applicable securities laws as if the transactions were for your own account. This Policy does not, however, apply to personal securities transactions of Family Members where the purchase or sale decision is made by a third party not controlled by, influenced by or related to you or your Family Member.

## Transactions by Entities that you Influence or Control

This Policy applies to any entity that you influence or control, including any corporations, partnerships or trusts (collectively referred to as 'Controlled Entities'), and transaction by these Controlled Entities should be treated for the purposes of this Policy and applicable securities laws as if they were for your own account.

## Transactions Under Company Plans

The Policy permits the following transactions that occur outside of an open trading window (defined below) or that may occur while you are in possession of material non-public information, except as specifically noted:

- 1. Stock Option Exercises. This Policy permits the exercise of an employee stock option acquired pursuant to the Company's plans, or to the exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which a person has elected to

## EXHIBIT 19.1

have the Company withhold shares subject to an option to satisfy tax withholding requirements. The restrictions in this Policy do apply, however, to any sale of stock as part of a broker-assisted cashless exercise of an option, or any other market sale for the purpose of generating the cash needed to pay the exercise price of an option.

- 2. Restricted Stock Award Vesting. This Policy permits the vesting of restricted stock, restricted stock units or similar Littelfuse Securities, or the exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which you elect to have the Company withhold shares of stock to satisfy tax withholding requirements upon the vesting of any restricted stock, restricted stock units or similar Littelfuse Securities. The restrictions in this Policy do apply, however, to any market sale of restricted stock or other Littelfuse Securities.
- 3. Dividend Reinvestment Plans. This Policy permits the purchase of Littelfuse Securities resulting from your automatic reinvestment of dividends paid on Littelfuse Securities.
- 4. Other Similar Transactions. Any other purchase of Littelfuse Securities from the Company or sales of Littelfuse Securities to the Company may be permitted upon prior approval by the Company.

## Special and Prohibited Transactions

The Company has determined that there is a heightened legal risk and/or the appearance of improper or inappropriate conduct if Covered Persons engage in certain types of transactions. It therefore is the Company's policy that Covered Persons may not engage in any of the following transactions, or should otherwise consider the Company's preferences as described below:

- 1. Short-Term Trading. Short-term trading of Littelfuse Securities may be distracting to the person and may unduly focus the person on the Company's short-term stock market performance instead of the Company's long-term business objectives. For these reasons, any director, officer or other associate of the Company who purchases Littelfuse Securities in the open market is discouraged from selling any Littelfuse Securities of the same class during the six months following the purchase (or vice versa).
- 2. Short Sales. Short sales of Littelfuse Securities ( i.e. , the sale of a security that the seller does not own) may evidence an expectation on the part of the seller that the securities will decline in value, and therefore have the potential to signal to the market that the seller lacks confidence in the Company's prospects. In addition, short sales may reduce a seller's incentive to seek to improve the Company's performance. For these reasons, short sales of Littelfuse Securities are prohibited. In addition, Section 16(c) of the Exchange Act prohibits directors and certain officers from engaging in short sales. (Short sales arising from certain types of hedging transactions are also governed by the paragraph below captioned 'Hedging Transactions.')
- 3. Publicly-Traded Options. Given the relatively short term of publicly-traded options, transactions in options may create the appearance that a director, officer  or  associate  is  trading  based  on  material  nonpublic  information  and  focus  a  director's,  officer's  or  other  associate's  attention  on  short-term performance at the expense of the Company's long-term objectives. Accordingly, transactions in put options, call options or other derivative securities, on an exchange or in any other organized market, are prohibited by this Policy. (Option positions arising from certain types of hedging transactions are governed by the next paragraph below.)
- 4. Hedging Transactions. Hedging or monetization transactions can be accomplished through a number of possible mechanisms, including through the use of financial instruments such as prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds. Such transactions may permit a director, officer or associate  to  continue  to  own  Littelfuse  Securities  obtained  through  employee  benefit  plans  or  otherwise,  but  without  the  full  risks  and  rewards  of ownership. When that occurs, the director, officer or associate may no longer have the same objectives as the Company's other shareholders. Therefore, directors, officers and employees are prohibited from engaging in any such transactions, except in the case of exceptional circumstances approved in advance by the Board of Directors.

## EXHIBIT 19.1

- 5. Margin Accounts and Pledged Securities. Securities held in a margin account as collateral for a margin loan may be sold by the broker without the customer's consent if the customer fails to meet a margin call. Similarly, securities pledged (or hypothecated) as collateral for a loan may be sold in foreclosure if the borrower defaults on the loan. Because a margin sale or foreclosure sale may occur at a time when the pledgor is aware of material nonpublic information or otherwise is not permitted to trade in Littelfuse Securities, directors, officers and other employees are prohibited from holding Littelfuse Securities in a margin account or otherwise pledging Littelfuse Securities as collateral for a loan. (Pledges of Littelfuse Securities arising from certain types of hedging transactions are governed by the paragraph above captioned 'Hedging Transactions.')

## Trading Window

The Company has established additional procedures in order to assist the Company in administration of this Policy, to facilitate compliance with laws prohibiting insider trading while in possession of material non-public information, and to avoid the appearance of any impropriety. These additional procedures govern even though the transactions may be permissible under law and apply to the following persons hereafter defined as the 'Window Group':

- · All directors of Littelfuse;
- · All executive officers of Littelfuse, including: the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer, all Executive Vice Presidents; all Senior Vice Presidents; the Chief Accounting Officer; and the Director of Internal Audit;
- · Any other employees designated by members of the Window Group; and
- · Family  members  of  the  above  who  live  in  the  same  household  or  who  are  financially  dependent  on  a  member  of  the  Window  Group,  as  well  as corporations, partnerships or trusts that hold, purchase or sell Littelfuse stock and that are controlled by members of the Window Group.

Members of the Window Group may only enter into transactions in Littelfuse Securities (including option exercises where the associated stock is sold, gifts, and derivative products such as puts, calls and collars) during an open trading window that commences three business days after the public release of the Company's quarterly or annual financial results and ends 40 days later. Even within the open trading window, all members of the Window Group must pre-clear all trades with the Legal Department. The Company may close an open trading window early at any time, as deemed appropriate by senior management.

The Legal Department will inform the Window Group electronically each quarter of the opening and closing of the trading window.

Certain members of the Window Group are also subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ('Section 16 Officers') and Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 applicable to affiliates of Littelfuse.

Event-specific Trading Restriction Periods. From time to time, an event may occur that is material to the Company and is known by only a few directors, officers and/or associates. As long as the event remains material and non-public, the persons designated by the Legal Department may not trade in Littelfuse Securities. The existence of an event-specific trading restriction period will not be announced to the Company as a whole and should not be communicated to any other person. Even if the Legal Department has not designated you as a person who should not trade due to an event-specific restriction, you should not trade while aware of material non-public information.

Exceptions.  The  quarterly  trading  restrictions  and  event-specific  trading  restrictions  do  not  apply  to  those  transactions  described  above  under  the  heading 'Transactions Under Company Plans.'

In  the  event  of  exceptional  personal  hardship,  a  member of the Window Group may petition the Legal Department for permission to trade outside the open trading window, assuming the person does not possess any material non-public information.

## Designated Broker

## EXHIBIT 19.1

Each transaction with respect to Littelfuse Securities under any equity plan sponsored or administered by Littelfuse shall be executed by a broker designated by Littelfuse. All Littelfuse Securities held by a Section 16 Officer, other than non-employee directors, must be owned through the broker designated by Littelfuse.

## Rule 10b5-1 Plans

Trades by members of the Window Group in Littelfuse's Securities that are executed pursuant to an approved Rule 10b5-1 plan are not subject to the prohibition on trading on the basis of material nonpublic information contained in this policy or to the restrictions set forth above relating to pre-clearance procedures and closed trading windows. Rule 10b5-1 provides an affirmative defense from insider trading liability under the federal securities laws for trading plans that meet certain requirements.

In general, a 10b5-1 plan must be adopted during an open trading window and must be entered into while you are not aware of material nonpublic information. Once the plan is adopted, you must not exercise any influence over the amount of securities to be traded, the price at which they are to be traded or the date of the trade. The plan must either specify (including by formula) the amount, pricing and timing of transactions in advance or delegate discretion on those matters to an independent third party. Except for plans entered into by Littelfuse, each plan must have an appropriate 'cooling off' period between the date a 10b5-1 plan is adopted (or modified) and the commencement of trading as contemplated in the plan. The cooling off period shall be the greater of 30 days and the minimum period required by applicable law or regulation, as determined by the Legal Department. Littelfuse requires that all 10b5-1 plans and all modifications to 10b5-1 plans be approved in writing in advance by the Legal Department. All 10b5-1 plans (and proposed modifications) should be submitted for approval at least five business days prior to entry into the 10b5-1 plan. The above requirements apply to all 10b5-1 plans entered into by Covered Persons or by Littelfuse.

## Post-Termination Transactions

This Policy continues to apply to transactions in Littelfuse Securities even after you have terminated your relationship with the Company. If you are in possession of material nonpublic information when your relationship terminates, you may not trade in Littelfuse Securities until that information has become public or is no longer material.

## EXHIBIT 97.1

## Compensation Recovery Policy (Required by NASDAQ Listing Rule 5608)

## Compensation Recovery

Subject to the limited exceptions set forth herein, with respect to the compensation of executive officers and former executive officers subject to this policy  as  described  under  'Applicability'  below,  Littelfuse,  Inc.  (the  ' Company ')  will  recover  reasonably  promptly  the  amount  of  erroneously  awarded incentive-based compensation in the event that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with  any  financial  reporting  requirement  under  the  securities  laws,  including  any  required  accounting  restatement  to  correct  an  error  in  previously  issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements (commonly referred to as a 'Big R' restatement), or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (commonly referred to as a 'little r' restatement).

For purposes of this policy, ' incentive-based compensation ' is any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a financial reporting measure. A ' financial reporting measure ' is a measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company's financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures. Stock price and total shareholder return are also financial reporting measures. A financial reporting measure need not be presented within the financial statements or included in a filing with the Commission.

## Applicability

This policy applies to incentive-based compensation received (as defined below) by a person: (i) after beginning service as an executive officer; (ii) who served  as  an  executive  officer  at  any  time  during  the  performance  period  for  that  incentive-based  compensation;  (iii)  while  the  Company's  common  stock remains  listed  on  NASDAQ  (or  another  national  securities  exchange  or  a  national  securities  association);  and  (iv)  during  the  three  completed  fiscal  years immediately preceding the date that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement as described under 'Compensation Recovery' above (plus any transition period to the extent required by NASDAQ rules in the event of a change in fiscal year).

For purposes of clause (iv) above, the date the Company is required to prepare such an accounting restatement is the earlier of: (1) the date the board of directors of the Company (the ' Board '), a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare such an accounting restatement; and (2) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare such an accounting restatement.

For purposes of this policy, ' executive officer ' means the Company's president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller), any vice-president in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance), any other officer who performs a policy-making function, or any other person who performs similar policy-making functions for the Company. Executive officers of the Company's subsidiaries are deemed executive officers of the Company if they perform such policy making functions for the Company. Policy-making function is  not  intended  to  include  policy-making  functions  that  are  not  significant.  Identification  of  an  executive  officer  for  purposes  of  this  section  would include at a minimum executive officers identified pursuant to Item 401(b) of Regulation S-K.

For  purposes  of  this  policy,  incentive-based  compensation  is  deemed  'received'  in  the  fiscal  period  during  which  the  financial  reporting  measure specified in the incentive-based compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the incentive-based compensation occurs after the end of that period.

This policy only applies to incentive-based compensation received (as defined above) on or after January 1, 2023.

## Determination of Amount Subject to Recovery

## EXHIBIT 97.1

The amount of incentive-based compensation subject to recovery under this policy (' erroneously awarded compensation ') is the amount of incentivebased compensation received that exceeds the amount of incentive-based compensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts, and must be computed without regard to any taxes paid.

For  incentive-based  compensation  based  on  stock  price  or  total  shareholder  return,  where  the  amount  of  erroneously  awarded  compensation  is  not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an accounting restatement: (i) the amount must be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect  of  the  accounting  restatement  on  the  stock  price  or  total  shareholder  return  upon  which  the  incentive-based  compensation  was  received;  and  (ii)  the Company must maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to NASDAQ as provided by the rules thereof.

## Limited Exceptions

The Company must recover erroneously awarded compensation in compliance with this policy except to the extent that one of the exceptions described in this section is applicable, and the compensation committee of the Board (the ' Compensation Committee '), or in the absence of such a committee or in the event it is not comprised solely of independent directors, a majority of the independent directors serving on the Board, has made a determination that recovery would be impracticable.

The exceptions referred to in the previous paragraph are as follows:

Direct Third-Party Expense Exceeds Recoverable Amount . The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this policy would exceed the amount to be recovered. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of erroneously awarded compensation based on expense of enforcement, the Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover such erroneously awarded compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide that documentation to NASDAQ as provided by the rules thereof.

Tax-Qualified Retirement Plans . Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder.

## No Indemnification

The Company will not indemnify any executive officer or former executive officer against the loss of erroneously awarded compensation.

## Disclosure

The Company will comply with all disclosure requirements with respect to this policy in accordance with the requirements of the applicable securities laws and NASDAQ rules.

## No Duplication of Recovery

To the extent that any compensation recoverable under this policy is also recoverable other than pursuant to this policy, including pursuant applicable law such as Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or pursuant to any other policy or agreement of the Company, then this policy will be administered in order to avoid duplicative recovery to the extent permitted by applicable law and NASDAQ rules. If any amounts that would also be recoverable hereunder have already been  reimbursed  by  a  person  to  the  Company  pursuant  to  applicable  law  or  another  policy  or  agreement,  such  amounts  may  be  credited  against  amounts recoverable from such person hereunder.

## Administration

This policy is intended to comply with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5608 and the applicable provisions Rule 10D-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and shall be administered and interpreted in a manner consistent

## EXHIBIT 97.1

with such rules and the applicable guidance of NASDAQ and the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect thereto.

This policy will be administered by the Compensation Committee, or in the absence of such a committee or in the event it is not comprised solely of independent directors, a majority of the independent directors serving on the Board.
