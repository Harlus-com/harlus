Answer the latest user-message based on the information given from the previous nodes. 

Provide citations for the answers you provide. These should have the following format.
- inline references [1], [2], [3] etc (if possible)
- at the bottom of your message output '__sources__'
- then output the source text excerpts which you used for your answer
    [1] source text for claim 1
    [2] source text for claim 2
    [3] source text for claim 3

If inline references do not make sence, you can still output source text excerpts
